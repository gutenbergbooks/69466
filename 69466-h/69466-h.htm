  <h2 class='c006'>TO THE READER.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'>That I may not obtain credit for more learning than
I possess, I beg to acknowledge the assistance I have
received in my version of the curious relict of antiquity
now offered to the public from the beautiful Italian MSS.
of the erudite Professor of Greek in the university
of&#160;*****. I hesitate to designate more clearly the
illustrious Hellenist whose labors have brought to light
this curious fragment. Since the establishment of the
saintly domination of the Vandals throughout the territories
of the rebellious and heterodox Italy, and particularly
in consequence of the ordinance of his most orthodox,
most legitimate, and most Austrian majesty, bearing
that his dominions being in want of good subjects,
his colleges are forbidden to send forth good scholars,<a id='r1'></a><a href='#f1' class='c008'><sup>[1]</sup></a>
it has become necessary for the gownsmen of the classic
peninsula to banish all profane learning from their lectures
and their libraries, and to evince a holy abhorrence
<span class='pageno' id='Page_vi'>vi</span>of the sciences and arts which they erst professed. The
list of the class books now employed in the transalpine
schools is exceedingly curious; I regret that I have mislaid
the one lately supplied to me by an illustrious Italian
exile. My memory recalls to me only that, in the
school of rhetoric, the orations of Cicero are superseded
by those of the Marquis of Londonderry, and the philippics
of Demosthenes by those of M. de Peyronnet; that
the professors of history have banished the decades of
Livy for <i>the Martyrs</i> of Mons. de Chateaubriand; and
that the students of Greek, in place of the Odes of Pindar,
and the retreat of the ten thousand from Cunaxa,
construe the hexameters of the English Laureate, and
the advance of Louis the XVIII. upon Ghent. In this
state of the Italian world of Letters, it is not surprising
that the scholar, to whose perseverance, ingenuity, and
learning, the public are indebted for the following fragment,
should object to lay claim to the honor which is
his due.</p>

<div class='footnote' id='f1'>
<p class='c009'><a href='#r1'>1</a>. <i><span lang="fr">Je ne veux pas de savans dans mes etats, je veux de bons
sujets</span></i>, was the dictum of the Austrian Autocrat to an
Italian Professor.</p>
</div>

<p class='c009'>The original MS. fell into the hands of my erudite correspondent
in the autumn of the year 1817. From that
period until the commencement of last winter, all his
leisure hours were devoted to the arduous task of unrolling
the leaves, and decyphering the half defaced characters.
The imperfect condition of the MS. soon obliged
him to forego his first intention of transcribing the original
Greek; he had recourse, therefore, to an Italian version,
supplying the chasms, consisting sometimes of a word,
sometimes of a line, and occasionally of a phrase, with a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_vii'>vii</span>careful and laborious study of the context. While this
version was printing at Florence, a MS. copy was transmitted
to me in Paris, with a request that I would forthwith
see it translated into the English and French languages.
The former version I undertook myself, and
can assure the reader that it possesses the merit of fidelity.
The first erudite translator has not conceived it
necessary to encumber the volume with marginal notes;
nor have I found either the inclination or the ability to
supply them. Those who should wish to refer to the
allusions scattered through the old classics to the characters
and systems here treated of, will find much assistance
from the marginal authorities of the eloquent and
ingenious Bayle.</p>

<p class='c009'>I have only to add, that the present volume comprises
little more than a third of the original MS.; it will be
sufficient, however, to enable the public to form an estimate
of the probable value of the whole.</p>

  <h2 class='c006'>CHAPTER I.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'>“Oh! monstrous,” cried the young Theon,
as he came from the portico of Zeno. “Ye
Gods! and will ye suffer your names to be
thus blasphemed? Why do ye not strike with
thunder the actor and teacher of such enormities?
What! will ye suffer our youth, and
the youth of after ages, to be seduced by this
shameless Gargettian? Shall the Stoic portico
be forsaken for the garden of Epicurus? Minerva,
shield thy city! Shut the ears of thy
sons against the voice of this deceiver!”</p>

<p class='c009'>Thus did Theon give vent to the indignation
which the words of Timocrates had worked
up within him. Timocrates had been a disciple
of the new school; but, quarrelling with
his master, had fled to the followers of Zeno;
and to make the greater merit of his apostacy,
and better to gain the hearts of his new friends,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_10'>10</span>poured forth daily execrations on his former
teacher, painting him and his disciples in the
blackest colors of deformity; revealing, with
a countenance distorted as with horror, and a
voice hurried and suppressed as from the agonies
of dreadful recollections, the secrets of
those midnight orgies, where, in the midst of
his pupils, the philosopher of Gargettium officiated
as master of the accursed ceremonies
of riot and impiety.</p>

<p class='c009'>Full of these nocturnal horrors the young
Theon traversed with hasty steps the streets of
Athens, and, issuing from the city, without perceiving
that he did so, took the road to the
Piræus. The noise of the harbor roused him
to recollection, and feeling it out of tune with
his thoughts, he turned up the more peaceful
banks of Cephisus, and, seating himself on the
stump of a withered olive, his feet almost
washed by the water, he fell back again into
his reverie. How long he had sat he knew not,
when the sound of gently approaching footsteps
once more recalled him. He turned his
head, and, after a start and gaze of astonishment,
bent with veneration to the figure before
him. It was of the middle size, and robed in
white, pure as the vestments of the Pythia.
The shape, the attitude, the foldings of the garment,
were such as the chisel of Phidias would
<span class='pageno' id='Page_11'>11</span>have given to the God of Elocution. The
head accorded with the rest of the figure; it
sat upon the shoulders with a grace that a
painter would have paused to contemplate—elevated,
yet somewhat inclining forward, as if
habituated gently to seek and benevolently to
yield attention. The face a poet would have
gazed upon, and thought he beheld in it one of
the images of his fancy embodied. The features
were not cast for the statuary; they
were noble but not regular. Wisdom beamed
mildly from the eye, and candor was on the
broad forehead: the mouth reposed in a soft,
almost imperceptible smile, that did not curl
the lips or disturb the cheeks, and was seen
only in the serene and holy benignity that
shone over the whole physiognomy: It was a
gleam of sunshine sleeping on a lucid lake.
The first lines of age were traced on the brow
and round the chin, but so gently as to mellow
rather than deepen expression: the hair indeed
seemed prematurely touched by time, for it was
of a pure silver, thrown back from the forehead,
and fringing the throat behind with short
curls. He received benignly the salutation
of the youth, and gently with his hand returning
it—“Let me not break your meditations;
I would rather share than disturb them.” If
the stranger’s appearance had enchanted Theon,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_12'>12</span>his voice did now more so: never had a
sound so sweet, so musical, struck upon his ear.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Surely I behold and hear a divinity!” he
cried, stepping backwards, and half stooping
his knee with veneration.</p>

<p class='c009'>“From the groves of the academy, I see,”
said the sage, advancing and laying his hand
on the youth’s shoulder.</p>

<p class='c009'>Theon looked up with a modest blush, and
encouraged by the sweet aspect of the sage,
replied, “No; from the Stoic portico.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Ah! I had not thought Zeno could send
forth such a dreamer. You are in a good
school,” he continued, observing the youth
confused by this remark, “a school of real
virtue; and, if I read faces well, as I think I
do, I see a pupil that will not disgrace its doctrines.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Theon’s spirit returned; the stranger had
that look, and voice, and manner, which instantly
give security to the timid, and draw
love from the feeling heart. “If you <i>be</i> man,
you exert more than human influence over the
souls of your fellows. I have seen you but
one moment, and that moment has laid me
at your feet.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Not quite so low, I hope,” returned the
sage with a smile; “I had always rather be
the companion than the master.”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_13'>13</span>“Either, both,” said the eager youth, and
seizing the half-extended hand of the sage,
pressed it respectfully to his lips.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You are an enthusiast, I see. Beware, my
young friend! such as you must be the best or
the worst of men.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Then, had I you for a guide, I should
be the best.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“What! do you a stoic ask a guide?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I, a stoic! Oh! would I were! I yet stand
but on the threshhold of the temple.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“But standing there you have at least looked
within and seen the glories, and will not that
encourage you to advance? Who that hath
seen virtue doth not love her, and pant after
her possession?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“True, true; I have seen virtue in her
noblest form—Alas! so noble, that my eyes
have been dazzled by the contemplation. I
have looked upon Zeno with admiration and
despair.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Learn rather to look with love. He who
but admires virtue, yields her but half her due.
She asks to be approached, to be embraced—not
with fear, but with confidence—not with
awe but with rapture.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yet who can gaze on Zeno and ever hope
to rival him?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“You, my young friend: Why should you
<span class='pageno' id='Page_14'>14</span>not? You have innocence; you have sensibility;
you have enthusiasm; you have ambition—With
what better promise could Zeno
begin his career? Courage! courage! my
son!” stopping, for they had insensibly
walked towards the city during the dialogue,
and laying his hand on Theon’s head, “We
want but the will to be as great as Zeno.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Theon had drawn his breath for a sigh, but
his action and the look that accompanied it,
changed the sigh to a smile. “You would
make me vain.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“No; but I would make you confident.
Without confidence Homer had never written
his Iliad—No; nor would Zeno now be worshipped
in his portico.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Do you then think confidence would make
all men Homers and Zenos?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Not all; but a good many. I believe
thousands to have the seeds of excellence in
them, who never discover the possession. But
we were not speaking of poetry and philosophy,
only of virtue—all men certainly cannot be
poets or philosophers, but all men may be
virtuous.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I believe,” returned the youth with a
modest blush, “if I might walk with you
each day on the borders of Cephisus, I
should sometimes play truant at the portico.”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_15'>15</span>“Ye gods forbid (exclaimed the sage playfully)
that I should steal a proselyte! From
Zeno too? It might cost me dear.—What are
you thinking of?” he resumed, after a pause.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I was thinking,” replied Theon, “what a
loss for man that you are not teacher in the
gardens in place of the son of Neocles.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Do you know the son of Neocles?” asked
the sage.</p>

<p class='c009'>“The gods forbid that I should know him
more than by report! No, venerable stranger;
wrong me not so much as to think I have
entered the gardens of Epicurus. It is not
long that I have been in Athens, but I hope, if
I should henceforth live my life here, I should
never be seduced by the advocate of vice.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“From my soul I hope the same. But
you say you have not long been in Athens—You
are come here to study philosophy.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes; my father was a scholar of Xenocrates;
but when he sent me from Corinth, he
bade me attend all the schools, and fix with
that which should give me the highest views
of virtue.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“And you have found it to be that of
Zeno.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I think I have: but I was one day nearly
gained by a young Pythagorean, and have
<span class='pageno' id='Page_16'>16</span>been often in danger of becoming one of the
academy.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“You need not say <i>in danger</i>: For though I
think you choose well in standing mainly by
Zeno, I would have you attend all the schools,
and that with a willing ear. There is some
risk in following one particular sect, even the
most perfect, lest the mind become warped and
the heart contracted. Yes, young man! it is
possible that this should happen even in the
portico. No sect without its prejudices and its
predilections.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I believe you say true.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I <i>know</i> I say true,” returned the sage in a
tone of playfulness he had more than once
used; “I <i>know</i> I say true; and had I before
needed evidence to confirm my opinion, this our
present conversation would have afforded it.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“How so?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Nay, were I to explain, you would not now
credit me: No man can see his own prejudices;
no, though a philosopher should point
at them. But patience, patience! Time and
opportunity shall right all things. Why, you
did not think,” he resumed after a short
pause, “you did not really think you were
without prejudices? Eighteen, not more, if
I may judge by complexion, and without prejudices!
Why, I should hardly dare to assert
<span class='pageno' id='Page_17'>17</span>I was myself without them, and I believe I
have fought harder and somewhat longer
against them than you can have done.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“What would you have me do?” asked the
youth, timidly.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Have you do?—Why, I would have you
do a very odd thing—No other than to take a
turn or two in Epicurus’s garden.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Epicurus’s garden! Oh! Jupiter!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Very true, by Juno!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“What! To hear the laws of virtue confounded
and denied?—To hear vice exculpated,
advocated, panegyrized?—Impiety and
atheism professed and inculcated?—To witness
the nocturnal orgies of vice and debauchery?—Ye
gods, what horrors has Timocrates
revealed!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Horrors, in truth, somewhat appalling, my
young friend; but I should apprehend Timocrates
to be a little mistaken. That the laws
of virtue were ever confounded and denied, or
vice advocated and panegyrized, by any professed
teacher, I incline to doubt. And were I
really to hear such things, I should simply conclude
the speaker mad, or otherwise that he
was amusing himself by shifting the meaning of
words, and that by the term virtue he understood
vice, and so by the contrary. As to the
inculcating of impiety and atheism, this may
<span class='pageno' id='Page_18'>18</span>be exaggerated or misunderstood. Many are
called impious, not for having a worse, but a
different religion from their neighbors; and
many atheistical, not for the denying of God,
but for thinking somewhat peculiarly concerning
him. Upon the nocturnal orgies of vice
and debauchery I can say nothing; I am too
profoundly ignorant of these matters, either to
exculpate or condemn them. Such things may
be, and I never hear of them. All things are
possible. Yes,” turning his benignant face
full upon the youth, “even that Timocrates
should lie.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“This possibility had indeed not occurred to
me.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“No, my young friend; and shall I tell you
why? Because he told you absurdities. Let
an impostor keep to probability, and he will
hardly impose. By dealing in the marvellous,
he tickles the imagination, and carries away
the judgment; and judgment once gone, what
shall save even a wise man from folly?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I should truly rejoice, to find the Gargettian’s
doctrine less monstrous than I have
hitherto thought them. I say <i>less monstrous</i>,
for you would not wish me to think them
good.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I would wish you to think nothing good,
or bad either, upon <i>my</i> decision. The first and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_19'>19</span>the last thing I would say to man is, <i>think for
yourself</i>! It is a bad sentence of the Pythagoreans,
‘The master said so.’ If the young
disciple you mentioned should ever succeed in
your conversion, believe in the metempsychosis
for some other reason than that Pythagoras
‘taught it.’”</p>

<p class='c009'>“But, if I may ask, do you think well of
Epicurus?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I meant not to make an apology for Epicurus,
only to give a caution against Timocrates—but
see, we are in the city; and fortunately
so, for it is pretty nigh dark. I have
a party of young friends awaiting me, and, but
that you may be apprehensive of nocturnal orgies,
I would ask you to join us.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I shall not fear them where I have such a
conductor,” replied the youth, laughing.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I do not think it quite so impossible, however,
as you seem to do,” said the sage, laughing
in his turn, with much humor, and entering
a house as he spoke; then throwing open with
one arm a door, and with the other gently
drawing the youth along with him, “I am
Epicurus!”</p>

<div class='chapter'>

  <h2 class='c006'>CHAPTER II.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'>The astonished, the affrighted Theon started
from the arm of the sage, and, staggering
backwards, was saved, probably, from falling,
by a statue that stood against the wall on one
side of the door: he leaned against it, pale and
almost fainting. He knew not what to do,
scarcely what to feel, and was totally blind
to all the objects around him. His conductor,
who had possibly expected his confusion, did
not turn to observe it, but advanced in such
a manner as to cover him from the view of the
company, and, still to give time for recollection,
stood receiving and returning salutations.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well met, my sons! and I suppose you
say well met, also. Are you starving, or am I
to be starved? Have you ate up the supper, or
only sat longing for it, cursing my delay?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“The latter, only the latter,” cried a lively
youth, hurrying to meet his master. Another
and another advanced, and in a moment he
was locked in a close circle.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Mercy! mercy!” cried the philosopher,
“drive me a step further and you will overturn
a couple of statues.” Then, looking over
his shoulder, “I have brought you, if he has
not run away, a very pleasant young Corinthian,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_21'>21</span>for whom, until he gain his own tongue,
I shall demand reception.” He held out his
hand with a look of bewitching encouragement,
and the yet faltering Theon advanced.
The mist had now passed from his eyes, and
the singing from his ears, and both room and
company stood revealed before him. Perhaps,
had it not been for this motion, and still more
this look of the sage, he had just now made a
retreat instead of an advance. “In the hall of
Epicurus—in that hall where Timocrates had
beheld”—oh! horrid imagination! “And he
a disciple of Zeno, the friend of Cleanthes—the
son of a follower of Plato—had he crossed
the threshhold of vice, the threshhold of the
impious Gargettian!” Yes; he had certainly
fled, but for that extended hand, and that bewitching
smile. These however conquered.
He advanced, and with an effort at composure,
met the offered hand. The circle made way,
and Epicurus presented “a friend.” “His
name you must learn from himself, I am only
acquainted with his heart, and that, on a
knowledge of two hours, I pronounce myself
in love with.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Then he shall be my brother,” cried the
lively youth who had before spoken, and he
ran to the embrace of Theon.</p>

<p class='c009'>“When shall we use our own eyes, ears,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_22'>22</span>and understandings?” said the sage, gently
stroking his scholar’s head. “See! our new
friend knows not how to meet your premature
affection.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“He waits,” returned the youth archly, “to
receive the same commendation of me that I
have of him. Let the master say he is in
love with my heart, and he too will open his
arms to a brother.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I hope he is not such a fool,” gaily replied
the sage. Then with an accent more
serious, but still sweeter, “I hope he will judge
all things, and all people, with his own understanding,
and not with that of Epicurus, or yet
of a wiser man. When may I hope this of
Sofron,” smiling and shaking his head, “can
Sofron tell me?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“No, indeed he cannot,” rejoined the
scholar, smiling and shaking his head also,
as in mimicry of his master.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Go, go, you rogue! and show us to our
supper: I more than half suspect you have devoured
it.” He turned, and familiarly taking
Theon by the shoulder, walked up the room, or
rather gallery, and entered a spacious rotunda.</p>

<p class='c009'>A lamp, suspended from the centre of the
ceiling, lighted a table spread beneath it with a
simple but elegant repast. Round the walls,
in niches at equal distances, stood twelve statues,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_23'>23</span>the work of the best masters; on either
hand of these burned a lamp on a small tripod.
Beside one of the lamps, a female figure was reclining
on a couch, reading with earnest study
from a book that lay upon her knee. Her
head was so much bowed forward as to conceal
her face, besides that it was shadowed by her
hand, which, the elbow supported on an arm
of the couch, was spread above her brows as a
relief from the glare of the light. At her feet
was seated a young girl, by whose side lay a
small cithara, silent, and forgotten by its mistress.
Crete might have lent those eyes their
sparkling jet, but all the soul of tenderness that
breathed from them was pure Ionian. The full
and ruddy lips, half parted, showed two rows
of pearls which Thetis might have envied.
Still a vulgar eye would not have rested on
the countenance: the features wanted the
Doric harmony, and the complexion was
tinged as by an Afric sun. Theon, however,
saw not this, as his eyes fell on those of the
girl, uplifted to the countenance of her studious
companion. Never was a book read more
earnestly than was that face by the fond and
gentle eyes which seemed to worship as they
gazed. The sound of approaching feet caught
the ear of the maiden. She rose, blushed, half
returned the salute of the master, and timidly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_24'>24</span>drew back some paces. The student was still
intent upon the scroll over which she hung,
when the sage advanced towards her, and laying
a finger on her shoulder, “What read you,
my daughter?” She dropped her hand, and
looked up in his face. What a countenance
was then revealed! It was not the beauty of
blooming, blushing youth, courting love and desire.
It was the self-possessed dignity of
ripened womanhood, and the noble majesty
of mind, that asked respect and promised delight
and instruction. The features were not
those of Venus, but Minerva. The eye looked
deep and steady from beneath two even brows,
that sense, not years, had slightly knit in the
centre of the forehead, which else was uniformly
smooth and polished as marble. The nose was
rather Roman than Grecian, yet perfectly regular,
and though not masculine, would have
been severe in expression, but for a mouth
where all that was lovely and graceful habited.
The chin was elegantly rounded, and turned in
the Greek manner. The color of the cheeks
was of the softest and palest rose, so pale, indeed,
as scarcely to be discernible until deepened
by emotion. It was so at this moment: startled
by the address of the sage, a bright flush
passed over her face. She rolled up the book,
dropped it on the couch, and rose. Her stature
<span class='pageno' id='Page_25'>25</span>was much above the female standard, but
every limb and every motion was symmetry
and harmony. “A treatise of Theophrastus;—eloquent,
ingenious and chimerical. I have
a fancy to answer it.” Her voice was full
and deep, like the tones of a harp when its
chords are struck by the hand of a master.</p>

<p class='c009'>“No one could do it better,” replied the
sage. “But I should have guessed the aged
Peripatetic already silenced by the most acute,
elegant, and subtle pen of Athens.” She
bowed to the compliment.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Is that then the famous Leontium?” muttered
Theon. “Timocrates must be a liar.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I know not,” resumed Leontium, “that I
should this evening have so frequently thought
Theophrastus wrong, if he had not made me
so continually feel that he thought himself
right. Must I seek the cause of this in the
writer’s or the reader’s vanity?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Perhaps,” said the master, smiling, “you
will find that it lies in both.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I believe you have it,” returned Leontium.
“Theophrastus, in betraying his self-love, hurt
mine. He who is about to prove that his own
way of thinking is right, must bear in mind
that he is about also to prove that all other
ways of thinking are wrong. And if this
should make him slow to enter on the undertaking,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_26'>26</span>it should make him yet more careful,
when he does enter on it, to do it with becoming
modesty. We are surely imperiously called
upon to make a sacrifice of our own vanity,
before we call upon others to make a sacrifice
of theirs. But I would not particularize Theophrastus
for sometimes forgetting this, as I
have never known but one who always remembers
it. Gentleness and modesty are qualities
at once the most indispensable to a teacher,
and the most rarely possessed by him. It was
these that won the ears of the Athenian youth
to Socrates, and it is these,” inclining to the
Master, “that will secure them to Epicurus.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Could I accept your praise, my daughter, I
should have no doubt of the truth of your
prophecy. For, indeed, the mode of delivering
a truth makes, for the most part, as much impression
on the mind of the listener as the truth
itself. It is as hard to receive the words of
wisdom from the ungentle, as it is to love, or
even to recognize virtue in the austere.” He
drew near the table as he spoke. Often during
supper were the eyes of Theon riveted on the
face of this female disciple. Such grace! such
majesty! More than all, such intellect! And
this—this was the Leontium Timocrates had
called a prostitute without shame or measure!
And this was the Epicurus he had blasted with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_27'>27</span>names too vile and horrible to repeat even in
thought! And these—continuing his inward
soliloquy as he looked round the board—these
were the devoted victims of the vice of an impious
master.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You arrived most seasonably this evening,”
cried Sofron, addressing the Philosopher;
“most seasonably for the lungs of two of your
scholars.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“And for the ears of a third,” interrupted Leontium.
“I was fairly driven into exile.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“What was the subject?” asked Epicurus.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Whether the vicious were more justly objects
of indignation or of contempt: Metrodorus
argued for the first, and I for the latter. Let
the master decide.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“He will give his opinion certainly; but that
is not decision.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well; and your opinion is that of——.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Neither.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Neither! I had no idea the question had
more than two sides.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“It has yet a third; and I hardly ever heard
a question that had not. Had I regarded the
vicious with indignation, I had never gained
one to virtue. Had I viewed them with contempt,
I had never sought to gain one.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“How is it,” said Leontium, “that the
scholars are so little familiar with the temper of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_28'>28</span>their master? When did Epicurus look on the
vicious with other than compassion?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“True,” said Metrodorus. “I know not
how I forgot this, when perhaps it is the only
point which I have more than once, presumed
to argue with him: and upon which I have
persisted in retaining a different opinion.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Talk not of presumption, my son. Who
has not a right to think for himself? Or who
is he whose voice is infallible, and worthy
to silence those of his fellow-men? And remember,
that your remaining unconvinced by
my arguments on one occasion, can only tend
to make your conviction more flattering to me
upon others. Yet, on the point in question, were
I anxious to bring you over to my opinion, I
know one, whose argument, better and more
forcible than mine, will ere long most effectually
do so.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Who mean you?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“No other than old hoary Time,” said the
Master, “who, as he leads us gently onwards
in the path of life, demonstrates to us many
truths that we never heard in the schools, and
some that, hearing there, we found hard to receive.
Our knowledge of human life must be
acquired by our passage through it; the lessons
of the sage are not sufficient to impart it. Our
knowledge of men must be acquired by our
<span class='pageno' id='Page_29'>29</span>own study of them; the report of others will
never convince us. When you, my son, have
seen more of life, and studied more men, you
will find, or at least, I <i>think</i> you will find, that
the judgment is not false which makes us lenient
to the failings—yea! even to the crimes of
our fellows. In youth, we act on the impulse
of feeling, and we feel without pausing to
judge. An action, vicious in itself, or that is
so merely in our estimation, fills us with horror,
and we turn from its agent without waiting to
listen to the plea which his ignorance could
make to our mercy. In our ripened years, supposing
our judgment to have ripened also,
when all the insidious temptations that misguided
him, and all the disadvantages that he
has labored under, perhaps from his birth, are
apparent to us—it is then, and not till then,
that our indignation at the crime is lost in our
pity of the man.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I am the last,” said Metrodorus, a crimson
blush spreading over his face, “who should
object to my master his clemency towards the
offending. But there are vices, different from
those he saved me from, which, if not more unworthy,
are perhaps more unpardonable, because
committed with less temptation; and
more revolting, as springing less from thoughtless
ignorance than calculating depravity.”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_30'>30</span>“Are we not prone,” said the sage, “to extenuate
our foibles, even while condemning
them? And does it not flatter our self-love, to
weigh our own vices against those of more erring
neighbors?”</p>

<p class='c009'>The scholar leaned forwards, and stooping
his face towards the hand of his master, where
it rested on the table, laid the deepening crimson
of his cheek upon it. “I mean not to exculpate
the early vices of Metrodorus. I love
to consider them in all their enormity; for the
more heinous the vices of his youth, the greater
is the debt of gratitude his manhood has to
repay to thee. But tell me,” he added, and
lifted his eyes to the benignant face of the sage,
“tell me, oh! my friend and guide! was the
soul of Metrodorus, found base or deceitful; or
has his heart proved false to gratitude and
affection?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“No, my son, no,” said Epicurus, his face
beaming with goodness, and a tear glistening
in his eye. “No! Vice never choked the
warm feelings of thy heart, nor clouded the
fair ingenuousness of thy soul. But, my son, a
few years later, and who shall say what <i>might</i>
have been? Trust me, none can drink of the
cup of vice with impunity. But you will say,
that there are qualities of so mean or so horrible
a nature, as to place the man that is governed by
<span class='pageno' id='Page_31'>31</span>them out of the pale of communion with the
virtuous. Malice, cruelty, deceit, ingratitude—crimes
such as these, should you think, draw
down upon those convicted of them no feelings
more mild than abhorrence, execration, and
scorn. And yet, perhaps, these were not always
natural to the heart they now sway.
Fatal impressions, vicious example, operating
on the plastic frame of childhood, may have
perverted all the fair gifts of nature, may have
distorted the tender plant from the seedling,
and crushed all the blossoms of virtue in the
germ. Say, shall we not compassionate the
moral disease of our brother, and try our skill
to restore him to health? But is the evil beyond
cure? Is the mind strained into changeless
deformity, and the heart corrupted in the
core? Greater then, much greater, will be our
compassion. For is not his wretchedness
complete, when his errors are without hope
of correction? Oh! my sons! the wicked
may work mischief to others, but they never
can inflict a pang such as they endure themselves.
I am satisfied, that of all the miseries
that tear the heart of man, none may compare
with those it feels beneath the sway of baleful
passions.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh!” cried Theon, turning with a timid
blush towards Epicurus, “I have long owned
<span class='pageno' id='Page_32'>32</span>the power of virtue, but surely till this night I
never felt its persuasion.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I see you were not born for a stoic,” said
the master smiling, “Why, my son, what made
you fall in love with Zeno?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“His virtues,” said the youth, proudly.</p>

<p class='c009'>“His fine face, and fine talking,” returned
the philosopher, with a tone of playful irony.
“Nay! don’t be offended;” and stretched his
hand to Theon’s shoulder, who reclined on the
sofa next him. “I admire your master very
much, and go to hear him very often.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Indeed!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Indeed? Yes, indeed. Is it so wonderful?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“You were not there”—Theon stopped
and looked down in confusion.</p>

<p class='c009'>“To-day, you mean? Yes, I was; and
heard a description of myself that might match
in pleasantry with that in ‘<i>The Clouds</i>’<a id='r2'></a><a href='#f2' class='c008'><sup>[2]</sup></a> of old
Socrates. Pray don’t you find it very like?”
He leaned over the side of the couch, and
looked in Theon’s face.</p>

<div class='footnote' id='f2'>
<p class='c009'><a href='#r2'>2</a>. Alluding to the comedy of Aristophanes, in which
Socrates was indecently ridiculed.</p>
</div>

<p class='c009'>“I—I—” The youth stammered and
looked down.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Think it is,” said the sage, as if concluding
the sentence for him.</p>

<p class='c009'>“No, think it is not; swear it is not;” burst
<span class='pageno' id='Page_33'>33</span>forth the eager youth, and looked as he would
have thrown himself at the philosopher’s feet.
“Oh! why did you not stand forth and silence
the liar?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Truly, my son, the liar was too pleasant to
be angry with, and too absurd to be answered.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“And yet he was believed?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Of course.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“But why then not answer him?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“And so I do. I answer him in my life.
The only way in which a philosopher should
ever answer a fool, or, as in this case, a
knave.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I am really bewildered,” cried Theon, gazing
in the philosopher’s, and then in Leontium’s
countenance, and then throwing a glance round
the circle. “I am really bewildered with astonishment
and with shame,” he continued,
casting down his eyes, “that I should have listened
to that liar Timocrates! What a fool
you must think me!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“No more of a fool than Zeno,” said the
sage, laughing. “What a philosopher listened
to, I cannot much blame a scholar for believing.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh! that Zeno knew you!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“And then he would certainly hate me.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“You joke.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Quite serious. Don’t you know that who
<span class='pageno' id='Page_34'>34</span>quarrels with your doctrine, must always quarrel
with your practice? Nothing is so provoking
as that a man should preach viciously and
act virtuously.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“But you do not preach viciously.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I hope not. But those will call it so, aye!
and in honest heart think it so, who preach a
different, it need not be a <i>better</i>, doctrine.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“But Zeno mistakes your doctrine.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I have no doubt he expounds it wrong.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“He mistakes it altogether. He believes
that you own no other law—no other principle
of action—than pleasure.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“He believes right.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Right? Impossible! That you teach men
to laugh at virtue, and to riot in luxury and
vice.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“There he believes wrong.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Theon looked as he felt, curious and uncertain.
He gazed first on the philosopher, and,
when he did not proceed, timidly round the circle.
Every face had a smile on it.</p>

<p class='c009'>“The orgies are concluded,” said Epicurus,
rising, and turning with affected gravity to the
young Corinthian. “You have seen the horrors
of the night; if they have left any curiosity
for the mysteries of the day, seek our garden
to-morrow at sunrise, and you shall be initiated.”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_35'>35</span>
  <h2 class='c006'>CHAPTER III.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'>The steeds of the sun had not mounted the
horizon, when Theon took the road to the garden.
He found the gate open. The path he
entered on was broad and even, and shaded on
either side by rows of cork, lime, oak, and
other the finest trees of the forest: pursuing
this for some way, he suddenly opened on a
fair and varied lawn, through which the Illissus,
now of the whitest silver in the pale twilight,
stole with a gentle and noiseless course.
Crossing the lawn, he struck into a close
thicket: the orange, the laurel, and the myrtle,
hung over his head, whose flowers, slowly
opening to the breeze and light of morning,
dropped dews and perfumes. A luxurious indolence
crept over his soul; he breathed the airs,
and felt the bliss of Elysium. With slow and
measured steps he threaded the maze, till he
entered suddenly on a small open plot of verdure
in face of a beautiful temple. The place
was three parts encircled with a wood of flowering
shrubs, the rest was girded by the winding
Illissus, over which the eye wandered to
glades and softly swelling hills, whose bosoms
<span class='pageno' id='Page_36'>36</span>now glowed beneath the dyes of Aurora. The
building was small and circular; Doric, and of
the marble of Paros: an open portico, supported
by twenty pillars, ran round the edifice:
the roof rose in a dome. The roseate tints of
the east fell on the polished columns, like the
blush of love on the cheek of Diana, when she
stood before her Endymion.</p>

<p class='c009'>Theon stopped: the scene was heavenly.
Long had he gazed in silent and calm delight,
when his eye was attracted by the waving of a
garment on one side of the temple.—He advanced,
and beheld a figure leaning against one
of the pillars. The sun at that moment shot
his first beam above the hills: it fell full upon
the face of the son of Neocles: it was raised,
and the eyes were fixed as in deep meditation.
The features reposed in the calm of wisdom:
the arms were folded, and the drapery fell in
masses to the feet. Theon flew towards him
then suddenly stopped, fearing to break upon
his thoughts. At the sound, the sage turned his
head, “Welcome, my son,” he said, advancing
to meet him, “Welcome to the garden of pleasure,
may you find it the abode of peace, of
wisdom, and of virtue.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Theon bowed his head upon the hand of the
master. “Teach me, guide me, make me
what you will—my soul is in your hand.”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_37'>37</span>“It is yet tender, yet pure,” said the Gargettian;
“years shall strengthen it—Oh! let
them not sully it! See that luminary! lovely
and glorious in the dawn, he gathers strength
and beauty to his meridian, and passes in peace
and grandeur to his rest. So do thou, my son.
Open your ears and your eyes; know, and
choose what is good; enter the path of virtue,
and thou shalt follow it, for thou shalt find it
sweet. Thorns are not in it, nor is it difficult
or steep: like the garden you have now entered,
all there is pleasure and repose.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Ah!” cried Theon, “how different is virtue
in your mouth and in Zeno’s.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“The doctrine of Zeno,” replied the sage,
“is sublime: many great men shall come from
his school; an amiable world, from mine.
Zeno hath his eye on man, I—mine on men:
none but philosophers can be stoics; Epicureans
all may be.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“But,” asked Theon, “is there more than
one virtue?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“No, but men clothe her differently; some
in clouds and thunders; some in smiles and
pleasures. Doctors, my son, quarrel more
about words than things, and more about the
means than the end. In the Portico, in the
Lycæum, in the Academy, in the school of Pythagoras,
in the Tub of Diogenes, the teacher
<span class='pageno' id='Page_38'>38</span>points you to virtue; in the Garden he points
you to happiness. Now open your eyes, my
son, and examine the two Deities.—Say, are
they not the same? virtue, is it not happiness?
and is not happiness, virtue?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Is this, then, the secret of your doctrine?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“No other.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“But—but—where then is the dispute?
Truly, as you have said, in words not things.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, in a great measure, yet not altogether:
We are all the wooers of virtue, but we are
wooers of a different character.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“And may she not then favor one, more
than another?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“That is a question,” replied the Gargettian
playfully, “that each will answer in his own
favor. If you ask me,” he continued with one
of his sweetest tones and smiles, “I shall
say—that I feel myself virtuous, because my
soul is at rest.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“If this be your criterion, you should with
the stoics deny that pain is an evil.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“By no means: so much the contrary, I hold
it the greatest of all evils, and the whole aim
of my life, and of my philosophy, is to escape
from it. To deny that pain is an evil is such
another quibble as the Elean’s denial of motion:
that must exist to man which exists to
his senses; and as to existence or non-existence
abstracted from them, though it may afford an
<span class='pageno' id='Page_39'>39</span>idle argument for an idle hour, it can never
enter as a truth, from which to draw conclusions,
in the practical lessons of a master. To
deny that pain is an evil, seems more absurd
than to deny its existence, which has also been
done, for its existence is only apparent from its
effect upon our senses; how then shall we admit
the existence, and deny the effect, which
alone forces that admittance? But we will
leave these matters to the dialecticians of the
Portico. I feel myself virtuous because my
soul is at rest: With evil passions I should
be disturbed and uneasy; with uncontrolled
appetites I should be disordered in body as
well as mind,—for this reason, and for this
reason only, I avoid both.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Only!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Only: virtue is pleasure; were it not so, I
should not follow it.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Theon was about to break forth in indignant
astonishment: the Sage softly laid a hand upon
his arm; and, with a smile and bend of the
head demanding attention, proceeded: “The
masters who would have us to follow virtue
for her own sake, independent of any pleasure
or advantage that we may find in the pursuit,
are sublime visionaries, who build a theory
without examining the ground on which they
build it, who advance doctrines without examining
<span class='pageno' id='Page_40'>40</span>principles. Why do I gaze on the Cupid
of Praxiteles? because it is beautiful; because
it gives me pleasurable sensations. If it gave
me no pleasurable sensations, should I find it
beautiful; should I gaze upon it; or would
you call me wise if then I gave a drachma for
its possession? What other means have we of
judging of things than by the effect they produce
upon our senses? Our senses then being
the judges of all things, the aim of all men is
to gratify their senses; in other words, their
aim is pleasure or happiness: and if virtue
were not found to conduce to this, men would
do well to shun her, as they now do well to
shun vice.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“You own then no pleasure but virtue, and
no misery but vice.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Not at all: I think virtue only the highest
pleasure, and vice, or ungoverned passions
and appetites, the worst misery. Other pleasures
are requisite to form a state of perfect
ease; which is happiness; and other miseries
are capable of troubling, perhaps destroying,
the peace of the most virtuous and the wisest
man.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I begin to see more reason in your doctrine,”
said the youth, looking up with a timid
blush in the face of the Philosopher.</p>

<p class='c009'>“And less monstrous depravity,” replied the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_41'>41</span>Gargettian, laughing. “My young friend,”
he continued more seriously, “learn henceforth
to form your judgments upon knowledge, not
report. Credulity is always a ridiculous, often
a dangerous failing: it has made of many a
clever man, a fool; and of many a good man,
a knave. But have you nothing to urge
against me? You say you see more reason in
my doctrine, which implies that you think me
less wrong, but not right.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I am a young disputant,” answered Theon,
“and very unfit to engage with such a master.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“That does not follow; a bad logician may
have a good understanding; and a young mind
may be an acute one. If my argument have
truth in it, less than a philosopher will see it;
and if it have not, less than a logician may refute
it.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I think I could urge some objections,” replied
Theon; “but they are so confused and
indistinct, I almost fear to bring them forth.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I dare say I could forestall the most of
them,” said the Master. “But I had rather
leave your mind to its own exercise. Think
over the matter at leisure, and you shall start
your questions some evening or morning among
my scholars. Knowledge is better imparted
in a dialogue than a lecture; and a dialogue is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_42'>42</span>not the worse for having more than two interlocutors.
So! our walk has well ended with
our subject. Let us see what friends are here.
There are surely voices.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Their route had been circular, and had
brought them again in front of the temple.
“This is a favorite lodgment of mine,” said
the Sage, ascending the noble flight of steps
and entering the open door. The apartment,
spacious, vaulted, and circular, occupied the
whole of the building. The walls were adorned
with fine copies of the best pieces of Zeuxis
and Parrhasius, and some beautiful originals of
Appelles. A statue, the only one in the apartment,
was raised on a pedestal in the centre.
It was a Venus Urania, by the hand of Lysippus,
well chosen as the presiding deity in the
gardens of virtuous pleasure. The ceiling,
rising into a noble dome, represented the heavens—a
ground of deep blue; the stars, sun,
and planets in raised gold. But two living figures
soon fixed the attention of Theon. In one
he recognized Metrodorus, though he had not
the evening before much observed his countenance.
He stood at a painter’s easel. His figure
was more graceful than dignified, his face
more expressive than handsome. The eyes,
dark, piercing and brilliant, were bent in a
painter’s earnest gaze on his living study. The
<span class='pageno' id='Page_43'>43</span>forehead was short, raised much at the temples
and singularly over the brows. The hair of a
dark glossy brown, short and curled. The
cheeks at the moment deeply flushed with the
eagerness and, perhaps, the impatience, of an
artist. The mouth curled voluptuously, yet
not without a mixture of satire; the chin curved
upwards, slightly Grecian, assisted this expression.
His study was Leontium. She stood,
rather than leaned, against a pilaster of the
wall; one arm supported on a slab of marble,
an unrolled book half lying on the same, and
half in her opened hand. The other arm,
partly hid in the drapery, dropped loosely by
her side. Her fine face turned a little over the
left shoulder, to meet the eye of the painter.
Not a muscle played; the lips seemed not to
breathe: so calm, so pale, so motionless—she
looked a statue; so noble, so severely beautiful—she
looked the Minerva of Phidias.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I cannot do it!” cried Metrodorus, flinging
down his pencil. “I had need be Appelles, to
take that face.” He pushed back his easel in
disgust.</p>

<p class='c009'>“What!” said Leontium, her fine features
relaxing into a heavenly smile, “and is all my
patience to go for nothing?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I am a blundering blind Bœotian! a savage
Spartan!” continued the disappointed artist.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_44'>44</span>“There!” and seizing a brush, was
about to demolish his work.</p>

<p class='c009'>“For your life!” cried Leontium; and
starting forward, pulled aside his hand. “Oh!
the mad ill-temper of a genius! Why, friend,
if my face were half so fine as that, Juno
would be jealous of it.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“And who knows that she is not? A
daub! a vile daub!” still muttered the impatient
scholar, yet his face gradually relaxing its
anger, as in spite of itself, till it turned to meet
Leontium’s with a smile.</p>

<p class='c009'>“And there stand the Master and the young
Corinthian laughing at you,” said Leontium.</p>

<p class='c009'>They approached. “Are you a judge?”
asked Metrodorus of Theon.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I am afraid not, though the confession will
mar my compliments.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“But I am,” said the Gargettian humorously:
“And though I have all the inclination in
the world, yet I cannot quarrel with the performance.
Well outlined and finely colored.
The attitude and air hit exactly. The features
too—perhaps—the only possible perhaps my
ill-nature can stumble on, perhaps the expression
is too blooming, and less mental than that
of the original.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Why there—there it is!” cried the scholar,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_45'>45</span>his face resuming all its vexation. “The look
of an idiot instead of a genius.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Not quite that either: only of a Hebe instead
of a Juno. More like our Hedeia.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Like a monster!” muttered the angry artist.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh! Hercules, oh! Hercules!” cried the
sage. “What it is to rub a sore place! Better
break a man’s leg than blow a feather on
his razed shin. Had I (turning to Theon) told
him he had drawn a humpbacked Thersites he
would have blessed me, rather than for this
pretty compliment of a blooming-faced Hebe.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I might as well have done one as the
other: they were equally like the original.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I must bow to that compliment,” said Leontium,
laying her hand on her breast, and inclining
with affected gravity to the painter.</p>

<p class='c009'>He tried in vain to resist the laugh; then
looking to the master—“What would you
have me turn it to?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“As you object to a Hebe, to a philosopher
by all means. Silver the head a little, it may
be an admirable Epicurus.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Nay! don’t make the madman furious,”
said Leontium, placing her hand on Metrodorus’s
shoulder; then, addressing Theon, “Pray,
young man, if you want to be a philosopher,
never find an eye for painting, a finger for music,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_46'>46</span>or a brain for poetry. Any one of these
will keep a man from wisdom.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“But not a woman, I suppose,” retorted
Metrodorus, “as you have all three.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Ready at compliments this morning: but
if you wanted a bow for this, you should have
given it with a more gracious face. But come,
my poor friend; we will try to put you in good
humor—Nothing like a little flattery for this.
Here, my young Corinthian! (walking to the
other side of the room to a newly finished picture
that stood against the wall, and beckoning
Theon towards her) you may without skill
perceive the beauty of this work, and the excellence
of the likeness.”</p>

<p class='c009'>It was indeed striking. “Admirable!”
cried Theon after a long gaze of admiration,
and then turning to compare it with the original.</p>

<p class='c009'>“A little flattered, and more than a little, I
fear,” said Epicurus with a smile, as he moved
towards them.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Flattered!” exclaimed Metrodorus; “a
Parrhasius could not flatter such an original.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“You see how my scholars spoil me,” said
the Gargettian to Theon.</p>

<p class='c009'>“But you think,” continued Metrodorus,
“that I have done it common justice.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Much more than common:—It is your
<span class='pageno' id='Page_47'>47</span>master’s self. The dignity of his figure, the
grace of his attitude, the nobility of his features,
the divine benignity of his expression.—Had
we not the original to worship, we might
worship your copy.”</p>

<p class='c009'>They were interrupted by the entrance of a
crowd of disciples, in the midst of whose salutations
young Sofron rushed in, breathless with
running and convulsed with laughter.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_48'>48</span>
  <h2 class='c006'>CHAPTER IV.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'>“Prepare yourselves! Prepare yourselves!”
cried the panting scholar. “Oh! Pollux!
such a couple! The contrast might convulse a
Scythian.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“What is it? What is the matter?” cried
a dozen voices.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’ll explain directly—Give me breath—and
yet I must be quick, for they are close on
my heels. Gryphus, the cynic—some of you
must have seen him. Well, he’s coming side
by side with young Lycaon.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Coming here!” said the master smiling.
“What can have procured me the honor of
such a visit?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh! your fame, of course.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I suspect you are making a fool of the old
cynic,” said Epicurus.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Nay, if he be a fool, he is one without my
assistance: Lycaon and I were standing on the
steps of the Prytaneum, disputing about something,
I forget what, when by came Gryphus,
and stopping short at bottom of the steps, ‘Are
you disciples of Epicurus, of Gargettium?’
‘We are,’ answered I, for Lycaon only stood
<span class='pageno' id='Page_49'>49</span>staring in amazement. ‘You may show me
the way to him then.’ ‘With all my heart,’ I
again replying, Lycaon not yet finding his
tongue. ‘We are, at present, for the Gardens,
and shall hold it an honor to be conductors to
so extraordinary a personage.’ I wanted to
put him between us, but Lycaon seemed unambitious
of his share in this distinction, for,
stepping back, he slipped round to my other side.
Oh! Jupiter! I shall never forget the contrast
between my two companions. The rough,
dirty, hairy cynic on my right hand, and the
fine, smooth, delicate, pretty Aristippian on
my left. We brought the whole street at our
heels. Lycaon would have slunk away, but I
held him tight by the sleeve. When we were
fairly in the Gardens, I gave them the slip at
a cross-path, and run on before to give timely
notice, as you see. But, lo! Behold!”</p>

<p class='c009'>The two figures now appeared at the door.
The contrast was not much less singular than
the scholar had represented; and there was a
sort of faint prelude to a universal laugh,
which, however, a timely look from the Master
instantly quelled. Lycaon, from the lightness
of his figure, and delicacy of his features and
complexion, might have been mistaken for a
female: his skin had the whiteness of the lily,
and the blushing red of the rose: his lips the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_50'>50</span>vermil of coral: his hair soft and flowing; in
texture, silk; in color, gold: his dress was
chosen with studied nicety, and disposed with
studied elegance: the tunic of the whitest and
finest linen, fastened at the shoulder with a
beautiful onyx: the sash of exquisite embroidery,
and the robe of the richest Tyrian, falling
in luxuriant folds from the shoulders, and over
the right arm, which gracefully sustained its
length, for the greater convenience in walking:
the sandals, purple, with buttons of gold. Gryphus,
short, square, and muscular; his tunic of
the coarsest and not the cleanest woollen, in
some places worn threadbare, and with one
open rent of considerable magnitude that
proved the skin to be as well engrained as its
covering; his girdle, a rope: his cloak, or
rather rag, had the appearance of a sail taken
from the wreck of an old trader: his feet bare,
and thickly powdered with dust: of his face,
little more might be distinguished than the
nose; the lower part being obscured by a
bushy and wide-spreading beard, and the upper,
by a profusion of long, tangled and grisly
hair. The wondering disciples opened a passage
for this singular intruder, who, without
looking to the right or the left, walked on, and
stopped before Epicurus.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I suppose you are the Master, by the needless
<span class='pageno' id='Page_51'>51</span>trouble I see you take, in coming to meet
me.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“When Gryphus has possibly walked a mile
to meet Epicurus, Epicurus may without much
trouble walk a step to meet Gryphus.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“In my walk of a mile,” returned the cynic,
“there was no trouble: I took it for my own
pleasure.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“And my walk of a step I also took for
mine.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Aye, the pleasure of ceremony!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I may hope, then, this your visit is from
something more than ceremony—perhaps a
feeling of real friendship, or as a mark of your
good opinion.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I hate useless words,” returned the cynic,
“and am not come here either to make any, or
hearken to any. I have heard you much talked
of lately. Our streets and our porticoes buzz
eternally with your name, till now all wise
men are weary of it. I come to tell you this,
and to advise you to shut the gates of your gardens
forthwith, and to cease the harangues of a
master; since you only pass for a philosopher
among fools, and for a fool among philosophers.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I thank you for your honest advice and information,
friend; but as the object of a master
is not to teach the wise, but only the unwise,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_52'>52</span>do you not think I may still harangue
among fools to some little purpose, though Gryphus,
and all sages, will of course justly hold
me in contempt?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“And so that fools may be made wise, the
wise are to be plagued with folly?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Nay, you would surely cease to think that
folly which could make a fool wise.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“A fool wise! And who but a fool would
think that possible?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I grant it were difficult: but may it not
also sometimes be difficult to discover who is a
fool, and who not? Among my scholars
there, some doubtless may be fools, and some
possibly may not be fools.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“No,” interrupted the cynic; “or they
would not be your scholars.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Ah! I being a fool myself. Well reminded!
I had forgot that was one of our premises.
But then, I being a fool, and all my scholars
being fools, I do not see how much harm can
be done, either by my talking folly, or their
hearkening to it.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“No, if wise men were not forced to hearken
also. I tell you that our streets and our porticoes
buzz with your name and your nonsense.
Keep all the fools of Athens in your gardens,
and lock the gates, and you may preach folly
as long and as loud as you please.”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_53'>53</span>“I have but one objection to this; namely,
that my gardens would not hold all the fools
of Athens. Suppose, therefore, the wise men,
being a smaller body, were shut into a garden,
and the city and the rest of Attica left for the
fools?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I told you,” cried the cynic, in a voice of
anger, “that I hate useless words.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Nay, friend, why then walk a mile to
speak advice to me? No words so useless as
those thrown at a fool.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Very true, very true;” and so saying, the
stranger turned his back, and quitted the temple.</p>

<p class='c009'>“There,” said the son of Neocles to his smiling
disciples, “is a good warning to any, or all
of us, who would be philosophers.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Nay, master,” cried Sofron, “do you think
us in danger of following the pleasant example
of this savage? Do you, indeed, expect to see
Lycaon there, with beard, head and clothing,
after the fashion of Gryphus?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Not beard, head and clothing, perhaps,”
answered the Gargettian; “pride, vanity, and
ambition, may take less fearful coverings than
these.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Pride, vanity, and ambition? I should
rather suspect Gryphus of the want of all
three.”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_54'>54</span>“Nay, my son, believe me all those three
qualities were concerned in the carving of those
three frightful appendages of our cynic’s person.
Pride need not always lead a man to cut
mount Athos in two, like Xerxes; nor ambition,
to conquer a world, and weep that there
is yet not another to conquer, like Alexander;
nor vanity, to look in a stream at his own face
till he fall in love with it, like Narcissus.
When we cannot cut an Athos, we may leave
uncut our beard; when we cannot mount a
throne, we may crawl into a tub; and when
we have no beauty, we may increase our ugliness.
If a man of small, or even of moderate
talents, be smitten with a great desire of distinction,
there is nothing too absurd, perhaps
nothing too mischievous, for him to commit.
Our friend, the cynic, happily for himself and
his neighbors, seems disposed to rest with the
absurd. Erostratus took to the mischievous—to
eternize his name destroying that temple, by
the building of which Ctesiphon immortalized
his. Be it our care to keep equally clear of the
one as of the other.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Do you, then,” asked Theon, “think a desire
of distinction a vicious desire?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I think it is often a dangerous desire, and
very often an unhappy one.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“But surely very often a fortunate one,”
<span class='pageno' id='Page_55'>55</span>said Leontium. “Without it, would there
ever have been a hero?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“And perhaps,” returned the sage, with a
smile, “the world might have been as happy if
there had not.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, without arguing for an Achilles,
would there have been a Homer?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I agree with you,” replied the Master,
more seriously. “The desire of distinction,
though often a dangerous, and often an unhappy
desire, is likewise often, though I believe
here <i>sometimes</i> were a better word, a fortunate
one. It is dangerous in the head of a fool;
unhappy, in that of a man of moderate abilities,
or unfavorable situation, who can conceive
a noble aim, but lacks the talent or the means
necessary for its attainment. It is fortunate
only in the head of a genius, the heart of a
sage, and in a situation convenient for its
development and gratification. These three
things you will allow do not often meet in one
person.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yet,” said Theon, “how many great men
has Athens produced?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“But it is not a consequent that they were
happy?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Happy or not happy, who would refuse
their fate?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I like that feeling,” replied the Gargettian;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_56'>56</span>“nor do I dissent from it. The fate of
greatness will always be enviable, even when
the darkest storms trouble its course. Well-merited
fame has in itself a pleasure so much
above all pleasures, that it may weigh in the
balance against all the accumulated evils of
mortality. Grant then our great men to have
been fortunate; are they, as you say, so
many?—Alas! my son, we may count them
on our fingers. A generation, the most brilliant
in genius, leaves out of its thousands and
millions but three or four, or a dozen, to the
worship, even to the knowledge of futurity.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“And these, only these three, four, or a
dozen, have a right to the desire of distinction?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“As to the right,” replied the sage, playfully,
“I mean not to dispute that. The right
lies with all men in our democracy to sit in a
tub, or to walk in a dirty tunic.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“But you will allow of no end in ambition
but an absurd one.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I have not expressed myself well, or you
have not understood me well, if you draw that
conclusion. I surely have granted our great
men to have had great ends of ambition.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“But is it only great men, or men destined
to be great, that may have such ends?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I allowed that others might; I only said
<span class='pageno' id='Page_57'>57</span>that they would be unhappy in consequence.
The perfection of wisdom, and the end of true
philosophy, is to proportion our wants to our
possessions, our ambitions to our capacities.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Then,” cried Metrodorus, “I have substantially
proved myself this morning to be no philosopher,
when I chose a study beyond the
reach of my pencil.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“No,” said Leontium, playfully tapping his
shoulder, “the Master will make a distinction
between what is beyond the reach of our capacity,
and what beyond the reach of our practice.
Erostratus might <i>never</i> have planned the
edifice he destroyed; Ctesiphon could not <i>always</i>
have planned it.” The smile that accompanied
these words, lighted one yet more
brilliant in the face of Metrodorus. Theon
guessed that he felt more than admiration and
more than friendship for this female disciple.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Your remark was well timed and well
pointed,” said the Master, “and has saved me
some talking.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I am not sure of that,” cried Sofron, stepping
forwards; “for though Leontium has so
nicely worded the distinction between want of
capacity and want of practice in the general, I
should like to be told, how a man is to make
this distinction between his own in particular?
For instance, I have a fancy to turn philosopher,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_58'>58</span>and supersede my master; how am I to
tell, at my first nonplus in logic or invention,
whether the defect be in my capacity or my
practice?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“If it be only in the last, I apprehend you
will easily perceive it; if in the first, not so
readily. A man, if he set about the search,
will quickly discover his talents; he may continue
it to his death without discovering his
deficiencies. The reason is plain; the one
hurts our self-love, the other flatters it.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“And yet,” interrupted Theon, “I think, in
my first interview with the Philosopher of
Gargettium, he remarked, that thousands had
the seeds of excellence in them who never
found them out.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I see you have a good memory,” returned
the Master, “I did say so, and I think it still.
Many might have been heroes, and many philosophers,
had they had a desire to be either;
had accident or ambition made them look into
themselves, and inquire into their powers; but
though jewels be hid in a sack of oats, they
will never be found, unless the oats be shaken.
Remember, however, we are now speaking of
one class of men only—the ambitious: and
the ambitious will never have any seeds in
them, bad or good, that will not generate and
produce their proper fruit. Ambition is the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_59'>59</span>spur, and the necessary spur, of a great mind
to great action; when acting upon a weak
mind it impels it to absurdity, or sours it with
discontent.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Nay, then,” said Sofron, “’tis but a dangerous
inmate, as minds go; and I, for one,
had better have none of it, for I doubt I am
not born to be an Epicurus, and I am certain I
have no inclination to be a Gryphus.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well,” said the Master, “we have at least
to thank Gryphus for our morning’s dialogue.
If any of us wish to prosecute it farther, we
may do it over our repast—the sun has
reached his noon, so let us to the bath.”</p>

<p class='c009'>They left the temple, and crossing the gardens
in an opposite direction from that by
which Theon had entered, soon reached a gate,
which, to his surprise, opened on a court at the
back of the Gargettian’s house, the same in
which he had supped the preceding evening.</p>

  <h2 class='c006'>CHAPTER V.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'>The fervor of the day had declined, when
Theon issued to the street from the house of
Epicurus: at that instant he met in the face
his friend Cleanthes; he ran to his embrace;
but the young stoic, receding with mingled astonishment
and horror—“Ye gods! from the
house of Epicurus?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I do not marvel at your surprise,” returned
Theon, “nor, if I recall my own feelings of yesterday,
at your indignation.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Answer me quickly,” interrupted Cleanthes;
“is Theon yet my friend?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“And does Cleanthes doubt it?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“What may I not doubt, when I see you
come from such a mansion?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Nay, my brother,” said Theon, kindly
throwing his arm round the neck of his friend,
and drawing him onwards, “I have been in
no mansion of vice, or of folly.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I do not understand you,” returned the
stoic, but half yielding to his kindness; “I do
not know what to think, or what to fear.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Fear nothing; and think only good,” said
the Corinthian: “True, I come from the gardens
<span class='pageno' id='Page_61'>61</span>of pleasure, where I have heard very little
of pleasure, and a very great deal of virtue.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I see how it is,” returned the other; “you
have lost your principles, and I, my friend.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I do not think I have lost the first, and I
am very sure you have not lost the last!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“No!” exclaimed Cleanthes; “but I tell
you, yes;” and his cheeks flushed, and his
eyes flashed with indignation: “I <i>have</i> lost
my friend, and you have lost yours. Go!” he
continued, and drew himself from the arm of
Theon. “Go! Cleanthes hath no fellowship
with an apostate and a libertine.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“You wrong me; and you wrong Epicurus,”
said his friend, in a tone of more reproach
than anger: “But I cannot blame you;
yesterday I had myself been equally unjust.
You must see him, you must hear him, Cleanthes.
This alone can undeceive you—can
convince you; convince you of my innocence,
and Epicurus’s virtue.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Epicurus’s virtue! your innocence?—What
is Epicurus to me? What is he, or
should he be to you? Your innocence? And
is this fastened to the mantle of Epicurus: see
him to be convinced of your innocence?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, and of your own injustice: Oh!
Cleanthes, what a fool do I now know myself
to have been! To have listened to the lies of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_62'>62</span>Timocrates! To have believed all his absurdities!
Come, my friend! come with me and
behold the face of the Master he blasphemes!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Theon, one master, and but one master, is
mine. To me, whether Timocrates exaggerate
or even lie, it matters nothing.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“It does, or it should,” said the Corinthian.
“Will a disciple of Zeno not open his eyes to
truth? Not see an error and atone for it, by
acknowledging it? I do not ask you to be the
disciple of Epicurus—I only ask you to be
just to him, and that for your own sake, more
than mine, or even his.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I see you are seduced—I see you are
lost,” cried the stoic, fixing on him a look in
which sorrow struggled with indignation. “I
thought myself a stoic, but I feel the weakness
of a woman in my eyes.—Thou wert as my
brother, Theon; and thou—thou also art beguiled
by the Syren—left virtue for pleasure,
Zeno for Epicurus.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I have not left Zeno.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“You cannot follow both—you cannot be
in the day and under the night at one and the
same time.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I tell you there is no night in the gardens
of Epicurus.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Is there no pleasure there,” cried the stoic,
his mouth and brows curling with irony.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_63'>63</span>“Yes, there is pleasure there: the pleasure
of wisdom and virtue.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Ah! have you learnt the Gargettian subtleties
so soon? You have doubtless already
worshipped virtue under the form of the courtezan
Leontium; and wisdom under that of
her master and paramour, the son of Neocles.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“How little you know of either!” returned
Theon. “But I knew as little yesterday.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Cleanthes stopped. They were before the
stoic portico. “Farewell! Return to your
gardens. Farewell!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“We do not yet part,” said Theon: “Zeno
is still my master.” He followed his friend up
the steps. A crowd of disciples were assembled,
waiting the arrival of their master.
Some, crowded into groups, listened to the harangues
of an elder or more able scholar: others
walking in parties of six or a dozen, reasoning,
debating, and disputing: while innumerable
single figures, undisturbed by the buzz around
them, leaned against the pillars, studying each
from a manuscript, or stood upon the steps
with arms folded, and heads dropped on their
bosoms, wrapped in silent meditations. At the
entrance of Cleanthes, the favored pupil of
their master, the scholars made way, and the
loud hum slowly hushed into silence. He advanced
to the centre, and the floating crowd
<span class='pageno' id='Page_64'>64</span>gathered and compressed into a wide and deep
circle. All eyes bent on the youth in expectant
curiosity, for his countenance was disturbed,
and his manner abrupt.</p>

<p class='c009'>Cleanthes was of the middle size: so slender,
that you wondered at the erectness of his
gait and activity of his motion. His neck was
small; his shoulders falling; his head elegantly
formed; the hair smooth and close cut;
the forehead narrow, and somewhat deeply
lined for one so young: the eyebrows marked
and even, save a slight bend upwards, as by a
frown, above the nose. The eyes blue; but
their gaze was too earnest, and their spirit too
clear, to leave any of the melting softness so
usual with that color:—And yet there were
moments when this would appear in them;
and when it did, it went to the soul of him
who observed it, but such moments were short
and rare. The nose was finely and perhaps
too delicately turned; the mouth—mild and
always in repose. The cheeks were thin, and
though slightly flushed, the face had a look of
paleness till enthusiasm awoke, and deepened
all its dyes. The whole expression had more
spirituality and variety, and the manner more
agitation, than you would have looked for in
the first and favorite pupil of Zeno. The
youth turned a rapid glance round the circle:
<span class='pageno' id='Page_65'>65</span>he threw out his right arm; the mantle dropped
from his shoulder, and in a varied, piercing,
and yet melodious voice he began—</p>

<p class='c009'>“My friends! My brothers! Disciples of
Zeno and of virtue. Give me your ears, and
awake your faculties! How shall I tell the
dangers that surround you? How shall I
paint the demon that would ensnare you;
Timocrates hath escaped from his enchantments,
and told us that riot and revelling were
in his halls, that impiety was in his mouth;
vice in his practice; deformity in his aspect:
and we thought that none but souls born for
error, already steeped in infamy, or sunk in
effeminacy, could be taken in his toils and seduced
by his example. But behold! he hath
changed his countenance—he hath changed
his tongue:—amid his revels he hath put on
the garb of decency: in his riot he talks of
innocence; in his licentiousness, of virtue.
Behold the youth! they run to him with greedy
ears—they throng his gardens and his porticoes.
Athens, Attica, Greece, all are the Gargettian’s.
Asia, Italy, the burning Africa and
the frozen Scythia—all, all send ready pupils
to his feet. Oh! what shall we say? Oh!
how shall we stem the torrent? Oh! how
shall we fence our hearts—how our ears from
the song of the Syren?—to what mast shall
<span class='pageno' id='Page_66'>66</span>we bind ourselves, to what pilot shall we trust,
that we may pass the shores in safety without
dashing on the rocks?—But why do I speak?
Why do I enquire? Why do I exhort? Is
not the contagion already among us? In
the school of Zeno—in this portico—in this
circle are there not waverers—Yea, are there
not apostates?” Emotion choked his utterance:
he paused, and glanced his kindled eyes
round upon the audience. Every breath was
held in expectation; each looked on the other
in doubt, dismay, and inquiry. Theon’s heart
beat quick and high: he advanced one step,
and raised his arm to speak; but Cleanthes,
gathering his breath, again in a rapid voice
continued:—</p>

<p class='c009'>“Does this silence speak conscious guilt, or
startled innocence? The last: I will believe
the last. Praise be to the gods! praise to our
guardian, Minerva! praise to our great, our
glorious master, there are yet some sons left to
Athens and to Greece, who shall respect, follow,
and attain to virtue! Some choice and
disciplined souls who shall stand forth the light
and ornament of their age, and whose names
shall be in honor with those yet unborn.
Rouse, rouse up your energies! Oh! be firm
to Zeno, and to virtue! I tell you not—Zeno
tells you not, that virtue is found in pleasure’s
<span class='pageno' id='Page_67'>67</span>repose. Resistance, energy, watchfulness, patience,
and endurance—these, these must be
your practice, must be your habit, ere you can
reach the perfection of your nature. The ascent
is steep, is long, is arduous. To-day you
must ascend a step, and to-morrow a step, and
to-morrow, and to-morrow—and yet shall
you be far from the summit, from rest, and
from security. Does this appal you? Does
this disgust you? Go then to the Gardens!
Go to the man of Gargettium—he who calls
himself philosopher, and who loves and teaches
folly! Go, go to him, and he shall encourage
and soothe you. He shall end your pursuit,
and give you your ambition! He shall show
you virtue robed in pleasures, and lolling in
ease! He shall teach you wisdom in a song,
and happiness in impiety!—But I am told,
that Timocrates hath lied; that Epicurus is
not a libertine; nor Leontium a prostitute; nor
the youth of the Garden the ministers to their
lusts. Be it so. Timocrates must answer to
himself, whether his tale be the outpourings of
indignant truth, or the subtle inventions of malevolence:
with his own conscience be the secret:
to us it matters nothing. We, who have
nought to do with the doctrines of Epicurus,
have nought to do with his practice. Let him
who would vindicate the one, vindicate the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_68'>68</span>other: let him come forth and say, that the
master in the Gardens is not only pure in action,
but perfect in theory. Let him say, that
he worships virtue as virtue, and shuns vice as
vice. Let him say that he arms the soul with
fortitude, ennobles it with magnanimity, chastens
it with temperance, enlarges it with beneficence,
perfects it with justice;—and let him
moreover say, that he does this, not that the
soul so schooled and invigorated may lie in the
repose of virtue, but that it may exult in its
honor, and be fitted for its activity. Fie on
that virtue which prudence alone directs!
Which teaches to be just that the laws may
not punish, or our neighbors revenge:—to be
enduring—because complainings were useless,
and weakness would bring on us insult and
contempt:—to be temperate—that our body
may keep its vigor, our appetites retain their
acuteness, and our gratifications and sensualities
their zest:—to serve our friends—that
they may serve us;—our country—because
its defence and well-being comprehends our
own. Why all this is well—but is there
nothing more? Is it our ease alone we shall
study, and not our dignity?—Though all my
fellow-men were swept away, and not a mortal
nor immortal eye were left to approve or
condemn—should I not here—within this
<span class='pageno' id='Page_69'>69</span>breast, have a judge to dread, and a friend to
conciliate? Prudence and pleasure! Was it
from such principles as these that the virtue of
Solon, of Miltiades, of Aristides, of Socrates, of
Plato, of Xenophon, of all our heroes and all
our sages, had its spring and its nourishment?
Was it such virtue as this that in Lycurgus
put by the offered crown?—that in Leonidas
stood at Thermopylæ?—that in the dying
Pericles gloried that he had never caused a citizen
to mourn? Was it such virtue as this—that
spoke in Socrates before his judges?—that
sustained him in his prison—and when
the door was open, and the sails of the ready
ship unfurled, made him prefer death to flight;
his dignity to his existence?”</p>

<p class='c009'>Again the young orator paused, but his indignant
soul seemed still to speak from his
flashing eyes. His cheeks glowed as fire, and
the big drops rolled from his forehead. At
this moment the circle behind him gave way.
Zeno advanced into the midst: he stood by the
head and shoulders above the crowd: his
breast, broad and manly: his limbs, cast in
strength and symmetry: his gait, erect, calm,
and dignified: his features, large, grand, and
regular, seemed sculptured by the chisel for a
colossal divinity: the forehead, broad and serene,
was marked with the even lines of wisdom
<span class='pageno' id='Page_70'>70</span>and age; but no harsh wrinkles, nor playing
muscles disturbed the repose of his cheeks,
nor had sixty years touched with one thread of
silver his close black hair; the eyes, dark and
full, fringed with long straight lashes, looked in
severe and steady wisdom from under their
correct and finely arched brows: the nose
came from the forehead, straight and even: the
mouth and chin, were firm and silent. Wisdom
undisturbable, fortitude unshakeable, self-respect,
self-possession, and self-knowledge perfected,
were in his face, his carriage, and his
tread.</p>

<p class='c009'>He stopped before the youth, who had turned
at his approach. “My son,” fixing his calm
gaze on the working countenance of his pupil,
“what hath disturbed thy soul?” Cleanthes
laid a hand on his laboring breast: he made
one violent effort for composure and speech: it
failed. The hot blood forsook his cheeks: it
rushed again: again it fled: he gasped, and
dropped fainting at the feet of his Master.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_71'>71</span>
  <h2 class='c006'>CHAPTER VI.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Theon rushed forward: He knelt; he raised
the head of his friend: Breathless, agitated,
terrified, he called his name with the piercing
cry of agony and despair. All was commotion
and confusion. The scholars pressed forward
tumultuously; but Zeno, raising his arm, and
looking steadily round, cried “Silence!” The
crowd fell back, and the stillness of night succeeded.
Then motioning the circle towards
the street, to give way and admit the air, he
stooped and assisted Theon to support his reviving
pupil. Cleanthes raised his head,
turned his eyes wildly around, and then fixed
them on his master.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Gently,” said Zeno, as the youth struggled
in their arms for recollection, “gently, my
son.” But he made the effort: he gained his
feet, and throwing out his arm to a pillar near
him, turned his head aside, and for some moments
combated with his weakness in silence.
His limbs still trembled, and his face had yet
the hues of death, when, pressing his hand
with convulsive strength against the pillar, he
proudly drew up his form, turned his eyes
<span class='pageno' id='Page_72'>72</span>again upon his master, and mustering his broken
respiration, “Blame me, but do not despise
me.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I shall do neither, my son: the weakness
was in the body, not the mind.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“There has been want of command in both.
I ask not to be excused.” Then turning round
to his companions, “I may be a warning if not
an example. The Spartans expose the drunkenness
of their Helots to confirm their youth in
sobriety: let the weakness of Cleanthes teach
the sons of Zeno equanimity; and let them
say, If in the portico weakness be found, what
shall it be in the Gardens? But,” he continued,
addressing his master, “will Zeno pardon
the scholar who, while enforcing his nervous
doctrines on others, has swerved from them
himself?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Thou judgest thy fault as thou shouldst
judge it,” returned Zeno; “but comfort, my
son! He who knows, and knowing can acknowledge
his deficiency, though his foot be
not on the summit, yet hath he his eye there.
But say the cause, and surely it must be a
great one, that could disturb the self-possession
of my disciple.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“The cause was indeed a great one; no less
than the apostacy of a scholar from Zeno to
Epicurus.”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_73'>73</span>Zeno turned his eyes round the circle: there
was no additional severity in them, and no
change in his manner, or in his deep, sonorous
voice, when, addressing them, he said, “If one
or more, or all of my disciples be wearied of
virtue, let them depart. Let them not fear upbraidings
or exhortations; the one were useless
to you, the other unworthy of me. He who
sighs for pleasure, the voice of wisdom can
never reach, nor the power of virtue touch. In
this Portico truth will never be softened to
win a sickly ear; nor the severity of virtue,
will it ever be veiled to win a feeble heart.
He who obeys in act and not in thought;
he who disciplines his body and not his
mind; he who hath his foot in the Portico,
and his heart in the Gardens; he hath no
more to do with Zeno, than a wretch sunk in
all the effeminacy of a Median, or the gross
debauchery of a Scythian. There is no midway
in virtue; no halting place for the soul
but perfection. You must be all, or you may
be nothing. You must determine to proceed
to the utmost, or I encourage ye not to begin.
I say to ye, one and all, give me your ears,
your understandings, your souls, and your energies,
or <i>depart</i>!” Again he looked round
upon his scholars. A long and deep silence
<span class='pageno' id='Page_74'>74</span>succeeded: when young Theon, breaking
through his awe, and his timidity, advanced
into the centre, and craving sufferance with
his hand, addressed the assembly.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Though I should forfeit the esteem of
Zeno and the love of his disciples, I have
no choice but to speak. Honor and justice
demand this of me: first, to remove suspicion
from this assembly; next, to vindicate the
character of a sage whom the tongue of a liar
hath traduced; and, lastly, to conciliate my
own esteem, which I value beyond even the
esteem of the venerated Zeno, and of my beloved
Cleanthes.” He paused; and turning
to Zeno,—“With permission of the master, I
would speak.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Speak, my son: we attend.” Zeno retreated
among his disciples; and Cleanthes,
anxious and agitated for his friend, placed
himself behind the screen of a pillar. With a
varying cheek and a tremulous voice, the
youth began:—</p>

<p class='c009'>“In addressing an assembly accustomed to
the manly elocution of a Zeno, and the glowing
eloquence of a Cleanthes, I know I shall
be forgiven by my companions, and I hope
even by my severe master, the blushes and
hesitations of timidity and inexperience. I
open my mouth for the first time in public;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_75'>75</span>and in what a public is it? Let not, therefore,
my confusion be thought the confusion of
guilt;  but, as it truly is, of bashful inexperience.
First, to remove suspicion from this
assembly:—let not the scholars look with
doubt on each other; let not the master look
with doubt on his scholars. I am he who
have communed with the son of Neocles;—I
am he who have entered the gardens of pleasure;—I
am he whom Cleanthes hath pointed
at as the apostate from Zeno to Epicurus.” A
tumult arose among the scholars. Surprise,
indignation, and scorn, variously looked from
their faces, and murmured from their tongues.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Silence!” cried Zeno, casting his severe
glance round the circle. “Young man, proceed.”</p>

<p class='c009'>This burst of his audience rather invigorated
than dashed the youth. He freely threw forth
his arm; his eyes lighted with fire, and the
ready words flowed from his lips:—“I merit
not the hiss of scorn, nor the burst of indignation.
Desist, my brothers, till my artless tale
be told;—till you have heard, not my apology,
but my justification. Yesterday, at this
hour, I left the Portico, heated to fury by the
philippic of Timocrates against Epicurus and
his disciples; indignant at the city that did
not drive such a teacher from its walls;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_76'>76</span>against the gods who did not strike him with
their thunders. Thus venting my feelings in
soliloquy, after a long ramble I seated myself
on the banks of Cephisus, and was awakened
from a reverie by the approach of a stranger:
his aspect had the wisdom of a sage, and the
benignity of a divinity. I yielded him the
homage of youthful respect and admiration:
he condescended to address me. He gave me
the precepts of virtue with the gentle and honied
tongue of kindness and persuasion. I
listened, I admired, and I loved. We did not
conclude our walk until sunset: he bade me
to his supper. I entered his house, and he told
me I beheld Epicurus. Could I have drawn
back? <i>Should</i> I have drawn back? No: my
heart answers, no. Your sufferance, my
friends! Do not interrupt me! Do not call
me an apostate! In the presence of the gods;
in the presence of my master, whom I fear as
them; in the presence of my own conscience,
which I fear more than both, I swear that I
am not so! I mean not to explain or to justify
the philosophy of Epicurus: I know but little
of it. I only know—I only affirm, that his
tongue has given new warmth to my love of
virtue, and new vigor to my pursuit of it:—I
only affirm, that persuasion, simple, ungarnished
persuasion, is in his lips; benevolence in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_77'>77</span>his aspect; urbanity in his manners: generosity,
truth, and candor in his sentiments:—I
only affirm, that order, innocence, and content,
are in his halls and his gardens; peace and
brotherly love with his disciples; and that, in
the midst of these, he is himself the philosopher,
the parent, and the friend. I see the
sneer of contempt upon your lips, my brothers;
alas! even on the unperturbed countenance
of my master I read displeasure.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“No, my son,” said Zeno, “thou dost not.
Continue thy artless tale. If there be error,
it lies with the deceiver, not the deceived.
And you, my sons and disciples, banish from
your faces and your breasts every expression
and every thought unworthy of your honest
companion, and your upright sect. For remember,
if to abhor falsehood and vice be noble,
to distrust truth and innocence is mean.
My son, proceed.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Thanks for your noble confidence, my
master: it makes me proud, for I deserve it.
Yes! even should I, as I perceive you apprehend,
be deceived, I feel that this open confession
of my present perfect conviction is honorable
both to myself and to Zeno.—It proves
that in his school I have learnt candor, though
I have yet to learn discernment. And yet,
methinks, however imperfect my youthful discernment,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_78'>78</span>it is not now in error. If ever I saw
simple, unadorned goodness; if ever I heard
simple, unadorned truth; it is in—it is from
Epicurus. Again your sufferance, my friends!
Again your sufferance, my master! I am
not—I wish not to be, a disciple of the Gardens:
virtue may be in them—excuse me,
virtue is in them, but there is a virtue in the
Portico which I shall worship to my latest
hour. Here, here I first learned—here I first
saw to what a glorious height of greatness a
mortal might ascend—how independent he
might be of fortune; how triumphant over fate!
Young, innocent, and inexperienced, I came to
Athens in search of wisdom and virtue. ‘Attend
all the schools, and fix with that which
shall give you the noblest aims,’ said my
father, when he gave me his parting blessing.
He being an academician, I had, of course,
somewhat imbibed the principles of Plato, and
conceived a love for his school: On first hearing
Crates, therefore, I thought myself satisfied.
Accident made me acquainted with a
young Pythagorean: I listened to his simple
precepts; I loved his virtues, and almost fell
into his superstitions. From these Theophrastus
awakened me; and I was nearly fixed as
a Peripatetic, when I met the eloquent, enthusiastic
Cleanthes. He brought me to the Portico,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_79'>79</span>where I found all the virtues of all the
schools united, and crowned with perfection.
But when I preferred Zeno, I did not despise
my former masters. I still sometimes visit the
Lycæum and the Academy, and still the
young Pythagorean is my friend. A pure
mind should, I think, respect virtue wherever
it be found: and if then in the Lycæum and
the Academy, why not the Gardens? Zeno,
in teaching austerity, does not teach intolerance;
much less, I am sure, does he teach
ingratitude: and if I did not feel for the sage
of Gargettium both respect and love, I were
the most ungrateful soul in Athens; and if
feeling both, I feared to acknowledge both, I
were the meanest. And now, my brothers,
ask yourselves what would be your indignation
at the youth, who for his vices being driven
from this Portico, should run to the Lycæum,
and accuse, to the sons of Aristotle, our
great Zeno of that sensuality and wickedness
which had here wrought his own disgrace, and
his own banishment? Would ye not hate
such a wretch? Would ye not loathe him?
Would ye not curse him? My brothers! this
day have I learned such a wretch to be Timocrates.
Is he here?—I hope he is: I hope
he hears me denounce him for a defamer and
an ingrate.”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_80'>80</span>“’Tis false!” cried Timocrates, bursting in
fury from the crowd. “’Tis false! I swear”—</p>

<p class='c009'>“Beware of perjury!” said a clear, silver
voice, from without the circle. “Give way,
Athenians! ’Tis for me to take up this quarrel.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The crowd divided. Every eye turned
towards the opening. Theon shouted with
triumph, Timocrates stood blank with dismay—for
they recognised the voice and the
form of the son of Neocles.</p>

  <h2 class='c006'>CHAPTER VII.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'>The Sage advanced towards Theon: he laid
a hand on either of his shoulders, and kissed
his glowing forehead. “Thanks to my generous
defender. Your artless tale, my son, if it
have not gained the ear of Zeno, hath fixed
the heart of Epicurus. Oh! ever keep this
candor and this innocence!” He turned his
benign face round the circle: “Athenians!
I am Epicurus.” This name so despised and
execrated, did it not raise a tumult in the assembly?
No; every tongue was chained,
every breath suspended, every eye riveted
with wonder and admiration. Theon had said
the truth: it was the aspect of a sage and a
divinity. The face was a serene mirror of a
serene mind: its expression spoke like music
to the soul. Zeno’s was not more calm and
unruffled; but here was no severity, no authority,
no reserve, no unapproachable majesty,
no repelling superiority: all was benevolence,
mildness, openness and soothing encouragement.
To see, was to love; and to hear,
was to trust. Timocrates shrunk from the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_82'>82</span>eye of his master: it fell upon him with a
fixed and deep gaze, that struck more agony
into his guilty soul, than had the flash of a
Cleanthes, or the glance of a Zeno. The
wretch sunk beneath it: he trembled; he
crouched; he looked as he would have supplicated
mercy; but his tongue cleaved to his
palate, and shame withheld him from quite
dropping on his knees. “Go! I will spare
thee. Give way, Athenians!” The scholars
opened a passage: again the Sage waved his
hand, and the criminal slunk away.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Your pardon, Zeno,” said the Gargettian,
“I know the youth: he is not worthy to
stand in the Portico.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I thank you,” returned the Master, “and
my disciples thank you. The gods forbid that
we should harbor vice, or distrust virtue. I
see, and I recant my error: henceforth if I cannot
respect the teacher, I shall respect the
man.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I respect both,” said Epicurus, reclining
his head to the stoic. “I have long known
and admired Zeno: I have often mixed with
the crowd in his Portico, and felt the might of
his eloquence. I do not expect a similar return
from him, nor do I wish to allure his scholars
to my Gardens. I know the severity of their
master, and the austerity, may I say, the intolerance
<span class='pageno' id='Page_83'>83</span>of his rules. But for one,” and he laid
his hand upon the head of Theon, “for this
one, I would bespeak clemency. Let not that
be imputed to him as a crime, which has been
the work of accident and of Epicurus: and
let me also say for him, as well as for myself—he
has lost in the Gardens no virtues, if
a few prejudices.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Son of Neocles,” said Zeno, “I feared you
yesterday, but I fear you doubly to-day. Your
doctrines are in themselves enticing, but coming
from such lips, I fear they are irresistible.
Methinks I cast a prophet’s eye on the map of
futurity, and I see the sage of Gargettium
standing on the pinnacle of fame, and a world
at his feet. The world is prepared for this: the
Macedonian, when he marched our legions to
the conquest of Persia, struck the death-blow
at Greece. Persian luxury, and Persian effeminacy,
which before crept, now came with
strides upon us. Our youth, dandled on the
lap of indulgence, shall turn with sickened ears
from the severe moral of Zeno, and greedily
suck in the honied philosophy of Epicurus.
You will tell me that you too teach virtue. It
may be so. I do not see it; but it may be so.
I do not conceive how there can be two virtues,
nor yet how two roads to the same.
This, however, I shall not argue. I will grant
<span class='pageno' id='Page_84'>84</span>that in your system, as elucidated by your
practice, there may be something to admire,
and much to love; but when your practice
shall be dead, and your system alone shall survive,
where then shall be the security of its innocence;—where
the antidote of its poison?
Think not that men shall take the good and
not the evil; soon they shall take the evil and
leave the good. They shall do more; they
shall pervert the very nature of the good, and
make of the whole, evil unmixed. Soon, in
the shelter of your bowers, all that is vicious
shall find a refuge. Effeminacy shall steal in
under the name of ease; sensuality and debauchery
in the place of innocence and refinement;
the pleasures of the body instead of
those of the mind. Whatever may be your
virtues, they are but the virtues of temperament,
not of discipline; and such of your followers
as shall be like you in temperament
may be like you in practice: but let them have
boiling passions and urgent appetites, and your
doctrines shall set no fence against the torrent;
shall ring no alarm to the offender. Tell us
not that that is right which admits of evil construction—that
that is virtue which leaves an
open gate to vice. I said that with a prophet’s
eye I saw your future fame; but such
fame as I foresee can but ill satisfy the ambition
<span class='pageno' id='Page_85'>85</span>of a sage. Your Gardens shall be crowded,
but they shall be disgraced; your name
shall be in every mouth, but every mouth
shall be unworthy that speaks it; nations shall
have you in honor, but ere it is so they shall be
in ruin: our degenerated country shall worship
you, and expire at your feet. Zeno, meantime,
may be neglected, but he shall never be slandered;
the Portico may be forsaken, but shall
never be disgraced; its doctrines may be discarded,
but shall never be misconstrued. I
am not deceived by my present popularity.
No school now in such repute as mine; but
I know this will not last. The iron and the
golden ages are run; youth and manhood are
departed; and the weakness of old age steals
upon the world. But, Oh! son of Neocles! in
this gloomy prospect a proud comfort is mine:
I have raised the last bulwark to the fainting
virtue of man, and the departing glory of nations:—I
have done more: when the virtue
and glory of nations shall be dead, and when
in their depraved generations some solitary
souls, born for better things, shall see and
mourn the vices around them, here in the
abandoned Portico shall they find a refuge;
here, shutting their eyes upon the world, they
shall learn to be a world to themselves;—here,
steeled in fortitude, shall they look down
in high, unruffled majesty on the slaves and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_86'>86</span>the tyrants of earth. Epicurus! when thou
canst say this of the Gardens, then, and not
till then, call thyself a sage and a man of virtue.”
He ceased; but his full tones seemed
yet to sound in the ears of his listening auditors.
There was a long pause, when the Gargettian
in notes, like the breathing flutes of Arcadia,
began his reply.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Zeno, in his present speech, has rested
much of the truth of his system on its expediency:
I therefore shall do the same by mine.
The door of my Gardens is ever open, and my
books are in the hands of the public; to enter
therefore, here, into the detail or the expounding
of the principles of my philosophy were
equally out of place and out of season. ‘Tell
us not that that is right which admits of evil
construction;—that that is virtue which leaves
an open gate to vice.’ This is the thrust
which Zeno now makes at Epicurus; and did
it hit, I grant it were a mortal one. From the
flavor, we pronounce of the fruit; from the
beauty and the fragrance, of the flower; and
in a system of morals, or of philosophy, or of
whatever else, what tends to produce good we
pronounce to be good, what to produce evil,
we pronounce to be evil. I might indeed support
the argument, that our opinion with regard
to the first principles of morals has
<span class='pageno' id='Page_87'>87</span>nought to do with our practice;—that whether
I stand my virtue upon prudence, or propriety,
or justice, or benevolence, or self-love, that
my virtue is still one and the same;—that the
dispute is not about the end, but the origin;
that of all the thousands who have yielded
homage to virtue, hardly one has thought of
inspecting the pedestal she stands upon; that
as the mariner is guided by the tides, though
ignorant of their causes, so does a man obey
the rules of virtue though ignorant of the principles
on which those rules are founded; and
that the knowledge of those principles would
affect the conduct of the man, no more than
acquaintance with the causes of the tides
would affect the conduct of the mariner. But
this I shall not argue; in doing so I might
seem but to fight you flying. I shall meet
your objection in the face. And I say—that
allowing the most powerful effects to spring
from the first grounds of a moral system;—the
worst or the best,—that mine, if the best
is to be so judged by the good it does and the
evil it prevents, must be ranked among the
best. If, as you say, and I partly believe, the
iron and the golden ages are past, the youth
and the manhood of the world, and that the
weakness of old age is creeping on us,—then,
as you also say, our youth, dandled on the lap
<span class='pageno' id='Page_88'>88</span>of indulgence, shall turn with sickened ears
from the severe moral of Zeno; and then <i>I</i>
say, that in the Gardens, and in the Gardens
only, shall they find a food, innocent, yet adapted
to their sickly palates; an armor, not of
iron fortitude, but of silken persuasion, that
shall resist the progress of their degeneracy, or
throw a beauty even over their ruin. But,
perhaps, though Zeno should allow this last
effect of my philosophy to be probable, he will
not approve it: his severe eye looks with
scorn, not pity, on the follies and vices of the
world. He would annihilate them, change
them to their opposite virtues, or he would
leave them to their full and natural sweep.
‘Be perfect, or be as you are. I allow of no
degrees of virtue, so care not for the degrees of
vice. Your ruin, if it must be, let it be in all
its horrors, in all its vileness: let it attract no
pity, no sympathy: let it be seen in all its
naked deformity, and excite the full measure
of its merited abhorrence and disgust.’ Thus
says the sublime Zeno, who sees only man as
he should be. Thus says the mild Epicurus,
who sees man as he is: With all his weaknesses,
all his errors, all his sins, still owning
fellowship with him, still rejoicing in his welfare
and sighing over his misfortunes: I call
from my Gardens to the thoughtless, the headstrong,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_89'>89</span>and the idle.—‘Where do ye wander,
and what do ye seek?—Is it pleasure? behold
it here. Is it ease? enter and repose.’ Thus
do I court them from the table of drunkenness
and the bed of licentiousness: I gently awaken
their sleeping faculties, and draw the veil from
their understandings. ‘My sons! do you seek
pleasure? I seek her also. Let us make the
search together. You have tried wine, you
have tried love; you have sought amusement
in revelling, and forgetfulness in indolence.
You tell me you are disappointed: that your
passions grew, even while you gratified them;
your weariness increased even while you slept.
Let us try again. Let us quiet our passions,
not by gratifying, but subduing them; let us
conquer our weariness, not by rest, but by exertion.’
Thus do I win their ears and their
confidence. Step by step I lead them on. I
lay open the mysteries of science; I expose the
beauties of art; I call the graces and the muses
to my aid; the song, the lyre, and the dance.
Temperance presides at the repast; innocence,
at the festival; disgust is changed to satisfaction;
listlessness, to curiosity; brutality, to elegance;
lust gives place to love; Bacchanalian
hilarity to friendship. Tell me not, Zeno, that
the teacher is vicious who washes depravity
from the youthful heart; who lays the storm
<span class='pageno' id='Page_90'>90</span>of its passions, and turns all its sensibilities to
good. I grant that I do not look to make men
happy. To teach them that in the discharge
of their duties as sons, as husbands, as fathers,
as citizens, lies their pleasure and their interest;—and
when the sublime motives of Zeno
shall cease to affect an enervated generation,
the gentle persuasions of Epicurus shall still be
heard and obeyed. But you warn me that I
shall be slandered, my doctrines misinterpreted,
and my school and my name disgraced. I
doubt it not. What teacher is safe from malevolence,
what system from misconstruction?
And does Zeno really think himself and his
doctrines secure? He knows not, then, man’s
ignorance and man’s folly. Some few generations,
when the amiable virtues of Epicurus,
and the sublime excellence of Zeno shall live
no longer in remembrance or tradition, the
fierce or ambitious bigots of some new sect
may alike calumniate both; proclaim the one
for a libertine, and the other for a hypocrite.
But I will allow that I am more open to detraction
than Zeno: that while your school
shall be abandoned, mine shall more probably
be disgraced. But it will be the same cause that
produces the two effects. It will be equally
the degeneracy of man that shall cause the
discarding of your doctrines, and the perversion
<span class='pageno' id='Page_91'>91</span>of mine. Why then should the prospect
of the future disturb Epicurus more than Zeno?
The fault will not lie with me any more
than you; but with the vices of my followers,
and the ignorance of my judges. I follow my
course, guided by what I believe to be wisdom;
with the good of man at my heart,
adapting my advice to his situation, his disposition,
and his capacities. My efforts may be
unsuccessful, my intentions may be calumniated;
but as I know these to be benevolent, so
I shall continue these, unterrified and unruffled
by reproaches, unchilled by occasional ingratitude
and frequent disappointment.” He ceased,
and again laying his hand on the shoulder
of Theon, led him to his Master. “I ask not
Zeno to admire me as a teacher, but let him
not blame this scholar for loving me as a
man.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I shall not blame him,” said the Stoic,
“but I wish that I may not soon distrust him.
I wish he may not soon forget Zeno, and forsake
the Portico.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The shades of evening now fell on the city,
and the assembly divided.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_92'>92</span>
  <h2 class='c006'>CHAPTER VIII.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'>The sun was in its fervor, when Theon
issued from one of the public baths. He was
not disposed for rest, yet the heat of the streets
was insufferable. “I will seek the Gardens,”
he thought, “and loiter in their cool shades
until the Master join me.” Reaching the
house of the Gargettian, and the entrance to
the Gardens being shorter through it than by
the public gate, he entered, and sought the passage
he had before traversed. He however
took a wrong one, and, after wandering for
some time, opened a door, and found himself
in a library. Epicurus was sitting in deep
study, with his tablets before him; his pen in
one hand, his forehead supported on the other.
Metrodorus, on the opposite side of the room,
was engaged in transcribing.</p>

<p class='c009'>Theon stopped, and, making a short apology,
hastily retired. “Stay!” cried the Master.
Theon again entered, but did not advance
much within the threshhold.</p>

<p class='c009'>“When I bade you stay, I did not mean to
fix you as doorkeeper. Come in, and shut the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_93'>93</span>door behind you.” Theon joyfully obeyed,
and hurried to seize the extended hand of the
sage. “Since you have intruded on the sanctuary,
I shall not drive you out.” He motioned
the youth to a place on his couch. “And
now, what pretty things am I to say to you for
your yesterday’s defence of the wicked Gargettian?
You should have come home with
me last night, when we were both hot from the
combat, and then I could have made you an
eloquent compliment in full assembly at the
Symposium, and you would as eloquently
have disclaimed it with one of your modest
blushes.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Then, truly, if the Master had such an intention,
I am very glad I did not follow him.
But I passed the evening at my own lodgings,
with my friend Cleanthes.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Trying to talk him into good humor and
charity, was it?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Something so.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“And you succeeded?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Why, I don’t know; he did not leave me
in worse humor than he came.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Nay, then it must have been in better.
Explanation always approaches or widens the
differences between friends.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, but we also entered into argument.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Dangerous ground that, to be sure. And
<span class='pageno' id='Page_94'>94</span>your fight, of course, ended in a drawn battle?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“You pay me more than a merited compliment,
in concluding that to be a thing of
course.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Nay, your pardon! I pay you any thing
but a compliment. It is not that I conclude
your rhetoric and your logic equal, but your
obstinacy and your vanity.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Do you know, I don’t think myself either
obstinate or vain,” said Theon, smiling.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Had I supposed you did, I might not have
seen occasion to give you the information.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“But on what grounds do you think me
obstinate and vain?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Your years; your years. And do you
think there is a man under twenty that is not
both?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Why, I should think an old man, at least,
more obstinate than a young one.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I grant you when he <i>is</i> obstinate, which is
pretty often, but not quite always; and when
he is vain, the same. But whilst many old
men have vanity and obstinacy in the superlative
degree, all young men have those qualities
in the positive. I believe your share to be
tolerably moderate, but do not suppose that
you have no share at all. Well, and now tell
me, was it not a drawn battle?”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_95'>95</span>“I confess it was. At least, we neither of
us convinced the other.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“My son, it would have added one more to
the seven wonders if you had. I incline to
doubt, if two men, in the course of an olympiad,
enter on an argument from the honest
and single desire of coming at the truth, or if,
in the course of a century, one man comes
from an argument convinced by his opponent.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, then, if you will allow me no credit
for not being convinced, you may at least for
my not being silenced, I, so young an arguer,
and Cleanthes so practised a one!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“You broke the ice beforehand yesterday in
the Portico,” said the Philosopher, tapping his
shoulder. “After that generous instance of
confidence, I shall not marvel if you now find
a tongue upon all proper occasions. And trust
me, the breaking of the ice is a very important
matter. Many an orator has made but
one spring to the land, and his legs, after he
had taken courage to make the first stroke.
Cleanthes himself found this. You know his
history? He first appeared in Athens as a
wrestler, a stranger to philosophy and learning
of all kinds. In our streets, however, the
buzz of it could not fail to reach him. He ran
full speed into the school of Crates. His curiosity,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_96'>96</span>joined to his complete ignorance, gave
him so singular an appearance, and produced
from him so many simple questions, and blundering
replies, that he received from his fellow
disciples the nickname of the Ass. But the Ass
persevered, and soon after, entering the Portico
he applied with such intense diligence to the
unravelling the mysteries of Zeno’s philosophy,
that he speedily secured the esteem of his
Master, and the respect of his companions.
But his timidity was for some time extreme,
and probably nothing but a sudden excitement
could have enabled him to break through it.
This, however, accidentally occurred, and he
is now the ready and powerful orator that you
know him.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I have often heard,” said Theon, “and really
not without some scepticism, the change
that a few years have wrought in Cleanthes;—<i>a
brawny wrestler</i>! who could believe
it? and a dull, ignorant Barbarian!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“The world always adds marvel to the
marvellous. A <i>brawny</i> wrestler he never was;
though certainly something stouter and squarer
in person than he is now; and though ignorant,
he was not dull. Intense application,
and some say, the fasting of poverty, as well
as temperance, rapidly reduced his body, and
spiritualized his mind.”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_97'>97</span>“The fasting of poverty!” cried Theon,
“do you believe this?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I fear it is possible,” returned the Master.
“At least it is asserted that he possessed but
four drachmas when he left the school of wrestling
for that of philosophy; and it does not
well appear that he now follows any other
trade than that of a scholar; one which certainly
brings very little nourishment to the
body, whatever it might do to the mind.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“But his Master; do you think Zeno would
suffer him to want the necessaries of life?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“The actual necessaries, somehow or other,
he certainly has; but I can believe he will
make very few serve, and procure those few
with some difficulty, rather than be indebted
even to his Master.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Or his friend!” said Theon.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Nay, remember, you are not a friend of
very long standing, and something his junior
in years.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“But should that prevent him from giving
me his confidence on such an occasion?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Perhaps not, but allow something to the
Stoic pride.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I can allow nothing to it here.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“No, because it touches your own. ‘<i>Thus
do I tread on the pride of Plato</i>,’ said Diogenes,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_98'>98</span>setting his foot on the robe of the Academic.
‘<i>Yes, with the greater pride of Diogenes</i>,’
returned Plato. But I have made you
grave, which was not my intention. Metrodorus,
how go you on?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Writing the last word.—There!—And
now,” rising and advancing towards Theon,
“let me embrace the youth who so nobly took
up the vindication of my insulted Master.
Perhaps you may not know how peculiarly I
am indebted to you. Timocrates is the brother
of Metrodorus.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“How!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I blush to own it.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“You need not blush, my loved son; you
have done more than a brother’s duty towards
him, and more than a disciple’s duty towards
me. I suppose,” turning to Theon, “as you
are a Stoic, you have not read the able treatises
of Metrodorus in support of my doctrines,
and defence of my character. In the last, indeed,
he has done more than I wished.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I own I have not, but I will read them.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“What! in the face of Zeno?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Aye, and of the whole Portico.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“We need not doubt the young Corinthian’s
courage,” said Metrodorus, “after his noble
confidence yesterday.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I see the Master has not been silent,” returned
<span class='pageno' id='Page_99'>99</span>Theon, “and that he has given me
more praise than is my due.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Metrodorus can tell you that is not my
custom,” said the Gargettian. “By Pollux!
if you continue your visits to the Garden, you
must look to be handled very roughly. I aim
the blow at every fault I see; and I have a
very acute pair of eyes. I find out the most
secret sins,—turn the souls of my scholars inside
out; so be warned in time!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I do not fear you,” returned the Corinthian.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Not fear me, you rogue?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“No, I love you too well. But,” continued
Theon, “let me now make my acknowledgments
to the Master for his coming forward so
seasonably yesterday, and giving me the victory.
How you astonished me! I almost took
you a second time for a divinity.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I will tell you how it happened,” returned
Epicurus: “Chancing to be called into the
street yesterday, just after you left the house,
I saw your meeting with Cleanthes; and
guessing from his first address, that you would
have to stand a siege, I followed you to the
Portico, and took my place, unnoticed, among
the crowd, ready, if occasion should require, to
offer my succor.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“And you heard then all that passed?”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_100'>100</span>“I did.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I beg your pardon for the digression,” said
Theon; “but I think you have more forbearance
and more candor than any man I ever
heard of.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“If it be so, these useful qualities have not
been attained without much study and discipline;
for Zeno is mistaken in thinking all my
virtues the children of temperament. I very
early perceived candor to be the quality the
most indispensable in the composition of a philosopher,
and therefore very early set my
whole efforts to the attaining of it. And when
once I fairly engaged in the work, I did not
find it either long or difficult. I had naturally
a mild temper, and a sensitive heart, and these
gifts were here of inconceivable use to me.
Feeling kindly towards my fellow-creatures, I
could the easier learn to pity rather than hate
their faults; to smile, rather than frown at
their follies.—This was a great step gained,
but the next was more difficult—to be slow
in pronouncing what is a fault, and what is a
folly. Our superstition would haunt with the
furies the man who should take his sister to
wife, while the customs of Egypt would commend
him. How has the astronomer been
laughed at, who made the earth revolve round
the stationary sun; and yet who can say but
<span class='pageno' id='Page_101'>101</span>the age may come, when this shall be established
as a truth? Prejudices, when once seen
as prejudices, are easily yielded. The difficulty
is to come at the knowledge of them. A
thousand lectures had I read to myself, ere I
could calmly say, upon all occasions, It does
not follow that the thing is, because I <i>think it
is</i>; and till I could say this, I never presumed
to call myself a philosopher. When I had
schooled myself into candor, I found I was possessed
of forbearance; for, indeed, it is hardly
possible to possess the one without the other.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I cannot understand,” said Theon, “how,
with your mildness, your candor, and your
good humor, you have so many enemies.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Am I not the founder of a new sect?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, but so have been many others.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“And you think I have more enemies than
any? If it be so, perhaps in those peaceable
qualities you have enumerated, you may seek
the cause. Remember the Cynics and Stoics,
(and I believe most of my enemies are either
among them, or of their making,) do you think
any of those three unpresuming virtues would
secure their approbation? They do not love
to see a man take the place of a philosopher,
without the airs of one, and, as you may perceive,
I want these most entirely. Then you
must remember also my popularity; for of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_102'>102</span>course my mildness, candor, and good humor,
along with other agreeable virtues which shall
be nameless, help to secure me a thousand
friends; and he who has many friends, must
have many enemies, for you know he must be
the mark of envy, jealousy, and spleen.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I cannot endure to think that it should be
so,” said Theon.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Much less can I,” said Metrodorus.</p>

<p class='c009'>“My sons, never pity the man who can
count more than a friend for every enemy, and
I do believe that I can do this! Yes, my
young Stoic, Zeno may have fewer enemies,
and as many disciples, but I doubt if he have
so many devoted children as Epicurus.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I know he has not,” cried Metrodorus,
curling his lip in proud scorn.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You need not look so fierce upon your
knowledge,” said the Master, smiling.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You are too mild, too candid,” returned
the scholar, “and that is your only fault.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Then I am a most faultless person, and I
only wish I could return the compliment to
Metrodorus, but his lip curls too much, and his
cheeks are too apt to kindle.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I know it, I know it,” said the scholar.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Then why not mend it?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Because I am not at all sure, but that it is
better unmended. If you would but turn more
<span class='pageno' id='Page_103'>103</span>fiercely upon your enemies, or let me do so for
you, they would respect you more, for they
would fear you more.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“But as I am not a god, nor a king, nor a
soldier, I have no claim to fear; and as I am a
philosopher, I have no wish for it. Then, as
to respect, do you really think yourself more
worthy of it than your Master?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Nay,” said Metrodorus, blushing, “that is
too severe a rub.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Grant that it was merited. No, no, my
son, we will convince all we can, we will
silence as few as possible, and we will terrify
none.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Remember the exit of Timocrates,” said
Theon, “was not that made in terror?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes; but it was the work of his conscience,
not of my eyes; if the first had been silent, I
imagine he would have stood the last very
well.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Do not name the wretch,” cried Metrodorus
indignantly. “Oh! my young Corinthian,
did you know all the patience and forbearance
that his Master had shown towards him, all
the pains he took with him, the gentleness with
which he admonished him, the seriousness
with which he warned him, the thousand
times that he forgave him; and then at last,
when he dared to insult his Master’s adopted
<span class='pageno' id='Page_104'>104</span>child, the lovely Hedeia, and the indignant disciples
thrust him from the Gardens, he goes to
our enemies, the enemies of his Master, and
feeds their malice with infernal lies. Curses
of the furies on the wretch!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Fie! how darest thou?” said Epicurus,
thrusting his scholar indignantly from him.
“Thy anger is unworthy of a man, how much
then of a brother! Go, and recollect thyself,
my son!” softening his voice, as he saw a
tear in Metrodorus’s eye.—“The Corinthian
will accompany you to the Gardens, I will join
you when I have concluded this treatise.”—Metrodorus
took the arm of Theon, and they
left the apartment.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_105'>105</span>
  <h2 class='c006'>CHAPTER IX.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'>“Do not,” said Metrodorus to Theon,
“take me as the best sample of the pupils of
Epicurus. We are not all so hot brained and
hot tongued.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Nay!” returned his companion, “I am too
young in philosophy to blame your warmth.
In your place, I should have been as hot myself.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I am glad to hear it. I like you the better
for the sentiment. But the sun scorches dreadfully,
let us seek shelter.”</p>

<p class='c009'>They turned into a thicket, and proceeding
some way, caught on the still air the notes of a
flute. They advanced and came to a beautiful
bank of verdure, bordered by the river, and
shadowed by a group of thick and wide
spreading oaks. “It is Leontium,” said Metrodorus.
“No other in Attica can breathe the
flute so sweetly.” They turned one of the
trunks, and found her lying on the turf; her
shoulder leaning against a tree, and her figure
raised on one elbow. Beside her was seated
the black eyed girl, whom Theon had before
<span class='pageno' id='Page_106'>106</span>seen; her taper fingers twining into a wreath
the scented flowers, which were lightly thrown
into her lap by the gay Sofron, who stood at
some distance among the shrubs.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Enough! enough!” said the gentle voice
of the girl, as the youth shook down in showers
the leaves and nectareous odors of the overripe
blossoms. “Enough! enough! stay thy
hand, thou heedless ravager!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Thank thee for thy words, although they
chide me,” said the boy, letting go the bough
which he had just seized, with a bound, light
as that of the shrub when it sprung upward
from his hand. “Thou hast but one feeling in
thy soul, Boidion; and thy nature belies the
sunny clime which saw its birth. Friendship
is all to thee, and that friendship is but for
one.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“In truth, thou repayest his cares but
coldly,” said Leontium, taking the pipe from
her mouth, and smiling on the dark haired
maiden.</p>

<p class='c009'>“But I repay not thine coldly,” said Boidion,
kissing the hand of her friend.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I am well punished for the neglect of my
morning’s lecture,” said Sofron impatiently, as
he snatched his book from the ground, and
turned away.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Part not in anger, brother!” exclaimed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_107'>107</span>Boidion. But the youth had vanished, and in
his place, Metrodorus and Theon stood before
her.</p>

<p class='c009'>The startled girl was about to rise, when
Leontium laying her hand on her arm, “Rest
thee, thou timid fawn,” and the maiden resumed
her seat.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I rejoice,” said Theon, as he placed himself
with Metrodorus by the side of Leontium,
and took up the pipe which had fallen from
her hand, “I rejoice to find this little instrument
restored to Athens.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Say not restored to Athens,” returned Leontium,
“only admitted into the Garden. I
doubt our vain youth still remember the curse
of Alcibiades, and looking in their mirror, vow
that none but fools would play on it.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“This recalls to me,” said Theon, “that I
have heard, among the various reports concerning
the Garden current in the mouths of
the Athenians, very contradictory ones as to
the place allowed in it to the sciences and liberal
arts, and to music in particular.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I suppose,” said Metrodorus, “that you
heard our whole employment was eating,
drinking, and rioting in all licentiousness.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“True I did hear so; and I fear I must confess,
half believed it. But I also heard your
licentiousness described in various ways;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_108'>108</span>sometimes as grossly sensual, enlivened by no
elegancies of art; veiled, adorned, if I may
use the expression, by no refinement. In
short, that Epicurus laughed as well at the fine
arts as the grave sciences. From others again,
I learned that music, dancing, poetry, and
painting were pressed into the service of his
philosophy; that Leontium strung the lyre,
Metrodorus the harp, Hedeia moved in the
dance, Boidion raised the song to Venus; that
his halls were covered with voluptuous pictures,
the walks of his gardens lined with indecent
statues.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“And you may now perceive the truth,” replied
Metrodorus, “with your own eyes and
ears.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“But,” said Leontium, “the young Corinthian
may be curious to know the sentiments
of our Master, and his advice regarding the
pursuit of the sciences and the liberal arts. I
can readily perceive,” addressing herself to
Theon, “the origin of the two contradictory
reports you have just mentioned. The first
you would hear from the followers of Aristippus,
who, though not acknowledging the name,
follow the <i>tenets</i> of his philosophy, and have
long been very numerous in our degenerate
city. These, because Epicurus recommends
but a moderate culture of those arts, which by
<span class='pageno' id='Page_109'>109</span>them are too often made the elegant incentives
to licentious pleasure, accuse him of neglecting
them altogether. The Cynics, and other
austere sects, who condemn all that ministers
to the luxury, ease, or recreation of man, exaggerate
his moderate use of these arts into a
vicious encouragement of voluptuousness and
effeminacy. You will perceive, therefore, that
between the two reports lies the truth. Every
innocent recreation is permitted in the Garden.
It is not poetry, but licentious poetry, that Epicurus
condemns; not music, but voluptuous
music; not painting, but licentious pictures;
not dancing, but loose gestures. Yet thus he
displeases alike the profligate and the austere,
for these he is too moderate, and for those too
severe. With regard to the sciences, if it be
said, that they are neglected among us, I do
not say that our Master, though himself versed
in them, as in all other branches of knowledge,
greatly recommends them to our study. But
that they are not unknown, let Polyœnus be
evidence. He, one of the most amiable men
of our school, and one most highly favored by
our Master, you must have heard mentioned
throughout Greece as a profound geometrician.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes,” replied Theon; “but I have also
<span class='pageno' id='Page_110'>110</span>heard, that since entering the Garden, he has
ceased to respect his science.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I am not aware of that,” said Leontium,
“though I believe he no longer devotes to it
all his time, and all his faculties. Epicurus
called him from his diagrams, to open to him
the secrets of physics, and the beauties of ethics;
to show him the springs of human action,
and lead him to the study of the human mind.
He taught him that any single study, however
useful and noble in itself, was yet unworthy
the entire employ of a curious and powerful
intellect: that the man who pursued one line
of knowledge, to the exclusion of others,
though he should follow it up to its very head,
would never be either learned or wise: that he
who pursues knowledge, should think no
branch of it unworthy attention; least of all,
should he confine it to those which are unconnected
with the business, and add nothing to
the pleasures of life: that further not our acquaintance
with ourselves, nor our fellows;
that tend not to enlarge the sphere of our affections,
to multiply our ideas and sensations, nor
extend the scope of our inquiries. On this
ground, he blamed the devotion of Polyœnus
to a science that leads to other truths than
those of virtue, to other study than that of
man.”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_111'>111</span>“I am obliged to you for the explanation,”
said Theon; “not because I could any longer
have given credit to the absurd reports of your
Master’s enemies; but because whatever opens
to me the character and opinions of such a
man, interests and improves me.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“You will find this,” said Metrodorus, “the
more you consider them. The life of Epicurus
is a lesson of wisdom. It is by example, even
more than precept, that he guides his disciples.
Without issuing commands, he rules despotically.
His wishes are divined, and obeyed as
laws; his opinions are repeated as oracles; his
doctrines adopted as demonstrated truths. All
is unanimity in the Garden. We are a family
of brothers, of which Epicurus is the father.
And I say not this in the praise of the scholars,
but the Master. Many of us have had bad
habits, many of us evil propensities, many of
us violent passions. That our habits are corrected,
our propensities changed, our passions
restrained, lies all with Epicurus. What I
myself owe him, none but myself know. The
giddy follower of licentious pleasure, the headstrong
victim of my passions, he has made me
taste of the sweets of innocence, and brought
me into the calm of philosophy. It is thus—thus,
by rendering us happy, that he lays us at
his feet,—thus that he gains, and holds the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_112'>112</span>empire of our minds,—thus that by proving
himself our friend, he secures our respect, our
submission, and our love. He cannot but
know his power, yet he exerts it in no other
way, than to mend our lives, or to keep them
innocent. In argument, as you may have observed,
he always seeks to convince rather
than sway. He is as free from arrogance as
from duplicity; he would neither force an
opinion on the mind, nor conceal from it a
truth. Ask his advice, and it is ever ready,—his
opinion, and he gives it clearly. Free from
prejudice himself, he is tender to that of
others; yet no fear of censure, or desire of popularity,
ever leads him to humor it, either in
his lessons, or his writings. Candor, as you
have already remarked, is the prominent feature
of his mind; it is the crown of his perfect
character.—I say this, my young Corinthian,
who know him. His soul, indeed, is open to
all; but I have approached very near it, and
considered its inmost recesses. Yes, I am
proud to say it—I am one of those he has
drawn most closely into his intimacy. With
all my imperfections and errors, he has adopted
me as a son; and, inferior as I am in years,
wisdom, and virtue, he deigns to call me his
friend.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Tears here filled the eyes of the scholar;—he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_113'>113</span>seemed about to resume, when a slight
sound made the party turn their heads, and
they saw the Master at their side.—“Do not
rise, my children, I will seat myself among
you.” Theon perceived he had heard the
closing sentence of Metrodorus, for the water
glistened in his eyes as he fixed them tenderly
upon him. “Thanks, my son, for this tribute
of thy gratitude; I have heard thy eulogy, and
I accept it joyfully. Let all men,” and he
turned his eye upon Theon, “be above flattery;
but let not a sage be above praise. He
that is so is either arrogant or insincere. For
myself, I own that the commendations of my
friends fill me with triumph, as the assurance
of their affection does with satisfaction. The
approbation of our familiars, who are with us
in our secret hours, hear our private converse,
know the habits of our lives, and the bent of
our dispositions, is, or should be to us, far
more pleasing and triumphant than the shouts
of a multitude, or the worship of the world.”</p>

<p class='c009'>There was a pause of some minutes, when
Leontium took up the word. “I have been
explaining, though very shortly and imperfectly,
your views concerning the studies most
proper to be pursued by men. I believe the
Corinthian has some curiosity on this point.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Theon assented.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_114'>114</span>“Knowledge,” said the Master, “is the best
riches that man can possess. Without it, he is
a brute; with it, he is a god. But like happiness,
he often pursues it without finding it; or,
at best, obtains of it but an imperfect glimpse.
It is not that the road to it is either dark or difficult,
but that he takes a wrong one; or if he
enters on the right, he does so unprepared for
the journey. Now he thinks knowledge one
with erudition, and shutting himself up in his
closet, he cons all the lore of antiquity; he
fathoms the sciences, heaps up in his memory
all the sayings of the dead, and reckoning the
value of his acquisitions by the measure of the
time and labor he hath expended on them, he
is satisfied he hath reached his end, and from
his retirement, looking down upon his more
ignorant, because less learned, brethren, he
calls them children and barbarians. But,
alas! learning is not wisdom, nor will books
give understanding. Again, he takes a more
inviting road: he rushes into the crowd; he
rolls down the stream of pleasure; he courts
the breath of popularity; he unravels or
weaves the riddles of intrigue; he humors the
passions of his fellows, and rises upon them to
name and power. Then, laughing at the credulity,
ignorance, and vice, he hath set his
throne upon, he says, that to know the world is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_115'>115</span>the only knowledge, and to see to dupe it, is to
be wise. Yet knowledge of the world is not
knowledge of man, nor to triumph in the passions
of others, is not to triumph over our own.
No, my sons, that only is real, is sterling
knowledge, which goes to make us better and
happier men, and which fits us to assist the
virtue and happiness of others. All learning
is useful, all the sciences are curious, all the
arts are beautiful; but more useful, more curious,
and more beautiful, is the perfect knowledge
and perfect government of ourselves.
Though a man should read the heavens, unravel
their laws, and their revolutions; though
he should dive into the mysteries of matter,
and expound the phenomena of earth and air;
though he should be conversant with all the
writings, and the sayings, and the actions of
the dead; though he should hold the pencil of
Parrhasius, the chisel of Polycletes, or the lyre
of Pindar; though he should do one or all of
these things, yet know not the secret springs
of his own mind, the foundation of his opinions,
the motives of his actions; if he hold not
the rein over his passions; if he have not cleared
the mist of all prejudices from his understanding;
if he have not rubbed off all intolerance
from his judgments; if he know not to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_116'>116</span>weigh his own actions, and the actions of others,
in the balance of justice—that man hath
not knowledge; nor, though he be a man of
science, a man of learning, or an artist, he is
not a sage. He must yet sit down, patient, at
the feet of philosophy. With all his learning,
he hath yet to learn, and perhaps a harder
task, he hath to unlearn.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The Master here paused, but the ears of
Theon still hung upon his lips. “Do not
cease,” he exclaimed. “I could listen to you
through eternity.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I cannot promise to declaim quite so long,”
returned the sage, smiling. “But if you wish
it, we will follow out the topic when we have
joined our other friends.”</p>

<p class='c009'>They rose, and bent their steps to the public
walk.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_117'>117</span>
  <h2 class='c006'>CHAPTER X.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Epicurus stood in the midst of his expectant
scholars. “My sons,” he said, “why do you
enter the Garden? Is it to seek happiness, or
to seek virtue and knowledge?—Attend, and
I will show you that in finding one, you shall
find the three. To be happy, we must be virtuous;
and when we are virtuous, we are
wise. Let us then begin: and first, let us
for awhile hush our passions into slumber,
forget our prejudices, and cast away our vanity
and our pride. Thus patient and modest,
let us come to the feet of Philosophy;
let us say to her, ‘Behold us, scholars and
children, gifted by nature with faculties, affections,
and passions.—Teach us their use, and
their guidance. Show us how to turn them to
account—how best to make them conduce
to our ease, and minister to our enjoyment.’</p>

<p class='c009'>“‘Sons of earth,’ says the Deity, ‘you have
spoken wisely; you feel that you are gifted by
nature with faculties, affections, and passions;
and you perceive that on the right exertion
and direction of these depends your well-being.
It does so. Your affections both of soul and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_118'>118</span>body may be shortly reduced to two, pleasure
and pain; the one troublesome, and the other
agreeable. It is natural and befitting, therefore,
that you shun pain, and desire and follow
after pleasure. Set forth then on the pursuit;
but ere you start, be sure that it is in the right
road, and that you have your eye on the true
object. Perfect pleasure, which is happiness,
you will have attained when you have brought
your bodies and souls into a state of satisfied
tranquillity. To arrive at this, much previous
exertion is requisite; yet exertion, not violent,
only constant and even. And first, the body,
with its passions and appetites, demands gratification
and indulgence. But beware! for
here are the hidden rocks which may shipwreck
your bark on its passage, and shut you
out forever from the haven of repose. Provide
yourselves then with a skilled pilot, who
may steer you through the Scylla and Charybdis
of your carnal affections, and point the
steady helm through the deep waters of your
passions. Behold her! It is Prudence, the
mother of the virtues, and the handmaid of
wisdom. Ask, and she will tell you, that
gratification will give new edge to the hunger
of your appetites, and that the storm of the
passions shall kindle with indulgence. Ask,
and she will tell you, that sensual pleasure is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_119'>119</span>pain covered with the mask of happiness. Behold,
she strips it from her face, and reveals
the features of disease, disquietude, and remorse.
Ask, and she will tell you, that happiness
is not found in tumult, but tranquillity;
and that, not the tranquillity of indolence and
inaction, but of a healthy contentment of soul
and body. Ask, and she will tell you, that a
<i>happy life is like neither to a roaring torrent,
nor a stagnant pool, but to a placid and crystal
stream, that flows gently and silently along</i>.
And now, Prudence shall bring to you the
lovely train of the virtues. Temperance,
throwing a bridle on your desires, shall gradually
subdue and annihilate those whose present
indulgence would only bring future evil; and
others more necessary and more innocent, she
shall yet bring down to such becoming moderation,
as shall prevent all disquiet to the soul,
and injury to the body. Fortitude shall
strengthen you to bear those diseases which
even temperance may not be efficient to prevent;
those afflictions which fate may level at
you; those persecutions which the folly or
malice of man may invent. It shall fit you
to bear all things, to conquer fear, and to meet
death. Justice shall give you security among
your fellows, and satisfaction in your own
breasts. Generosity shall endear you to others,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_120'>120</span>and sweeten your own nature to yourselves.
Gentleness shall take the sting from the malice
of your enemies, and make you extract double
sweet from the kindness of friends. Gratitude
shall lighten the burden of obligation, or render
it even pleasant to bear. Friendship shall put
the crown on your security and your joy.
With these, and yet more virtues, shall prudence
surround you. And, thus attended,
hold on your course in confidence, and moor
your barks in the haven of repose.’</p>

<p class='c009'>“Thus says Philosophy, my sons, and says
she not wisely? Tell us, ye who have tried
the slippery paths of licentiousness, who have
given the rein to your passions, and sought
pleasure in the lap of voluptuousness; tell us,
did ye find her there? No, ye did not, or ye
would not now inquire of her from Epicurus.
Come, then, Philosophy hath shown ye the
way. Throw off your old habits, wash impurity
from your hearts; take up the bridle of
your passions; govern your minds, and be
happy. And ye, my sons, to whom all things
are yet new; whose passions, yet in the bud,
have never led you to pain and regret; ye who
have yet to begin your career, come ye, also!
Philosophy hath shown ye the way. Keep
your hearts innocent, hold the bridle of your
passions, govern your minds, and be happy.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_121'>121</span>But, my sons, methinks I hear you say, ‘You
have shown us the virtues rather as modifiers
and correctors of evil, than as the givers of actual
and perfect good. Happiness, you tell us,
consists in ease of body and mind; yet temperance
cannot secure the former from disease,
nor can all the virtues united ward affliction
from the latter.’ True, my children, Philosophy
cannot change the laws of nature; but she
may teach us to accommodate to them. She
cannot annul pain; but she can arm us to bear
it. And though the evils of fate be many, are
not the evils of man’s coming more? Nature
afflicts us with disease; but for once that it is
the infliction of nature, ninety-nine times it is
the consequence of our own folly. Nature levels
us with death; but how mild is the death
of nature, with Philosophy to spread the pillow,
and friendship to take the last sigh, to the
protracted agonies of debauchery, subduing the
body by inches, while Philosophy is not there
to give strength, nor friendship consolation, but
while the flames of fever are heated by impatience,
and the stings of pain envenomed by
remorse! And tell me, my sons, when the
body of the sage is stretched on the couch of
pain, hath he not his mind to minister delight
to him? Hath he not conscience whispering
that his present evil is not chargeable to his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_122'>122</span>own past folly, but to the laws of nature,
which no effort or foresight of his could have
prevented? Hath he not memory to bring to
him past pleasures, the pleasures of a well-spent
life, on which he may feed even while
pain racks his members, and fever consumes
his vitals? Or, what if agony overpower his
frame, and cripple his faculties, is there not
death at hand to reach him deliverance?
Here, then, is death, that giant of terror, acting
as a friend. But does he interrupt our enjoyments
as well as our sufferings? And is it for
this we fear him? Ought we not rather to
rejoice, seeing that the day of life has its bright
and its clouded hours, that we are laid to sleep
while the sun of joy yet shines, before the
storm of fate has broken our tranquillity, or
the evening of age bedimmed our prospect?
Death, then, is never our foe. When not a
friend, he cannot be worse than indifferent.
<i>For while we are, death is not; and while death
is, we are not.</i> To the wise, then, death is
nothing. Examine the ills of life, are they not
of our own creation, or take they not their
darkest hues from our passions or our ignorance?
What is poverty, if we have temperance,
and can be satisfied with a crust, and a
draught from the spring?—if we have modesty,
and can wear a woollen garment as gladly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_123'>123</span>as a Tyrian robe? What is slander, if we
have no vanity that it can wound, and no anger
that it can kindle? What is neglect, if we
have no ambition that it can disappoint, and
no pride that it can mortify? What is persecution,
if we have our own bosoms in which
to retire, and a spot of earth to sit down and
rest upon? What is death, when without superstition
to clothe him with terrors, we can
cover our heads, and go to sleep in his arms?
What a list of human calamities are here expunged—Poverty,
slander, neglect, disappointment,
persecution, death! What yet remains?
Disease? That, too, we have shown temperance
can often shun, and Philosophy can always
alleviate. But there is yet a pain, which
the wisest and the best of men cannot escape;
that all of us, my sons, have felt, or have to
feel. Do not your hearts whisper it? Do you
not tell me, that in death there is yet a
sting? That ere he aim at us, he may level
the beloved of our soul? The father, whose
tender care hath reared our infant minds—the
brother, whom the same breast hath nourished,
and the same roof sheltered, with whom,
side by side, we have grown like two plants
by a river, sucking life from the same fountain
and strength from the same sun—the child
whose gay prattle delights our ears, or whose
<span class='pageno' id='Page_124'>124</span>opening understanding fixes our hopes; the
friend of our choice, with whom we have exchanged
hearts, and shared all our pains and
pleasures, whose eye hath reflected the tear of
sympathy, whose hand hath smoothed the
couch of sickness. Ah! my sons, here is indeed
a pain, a pain that cuts into the soul.
There are masters who will tell you otherwise,
who will tell you that it is unworthy of a man
to mourn even here. But such, my sons,
speak not the truth of experience, or Philosophy,
but the subtleties of sophistry and pride.
He who feels not the loss, hath never felt the
possession. He who knows not the grief, hath
never known the joy. See the price of a
friend in the duties we render him, and the
sacrifices we make to him, and which, in making,
we count not sacrifices, but pleasures!
We sorrow for his sorrow; we supply his
wants, or if we cannot, we share them. We
follow him to exile. We close ourselves in his
prison; we soothe him in sickness; we strengthen
him in death: nay, if it be possible, we
throw down our life for his. Oh! what a
treasure is that for which we do so much!
And is it forbidden us to mourn its loss? If it
be, the power is not with us to obey. Should
we, then, to avoid the evil, forego the good?
Shall we shut love from our hearts, that we
<span class='pageno' id='Page_125'>125</span>may not feel the pain of his departure? No;
happiness forbids it. Experience forbids it.
Let him who hath laid on the pyre the dearest
of his soul, who hath washed the urn with the
bitterest tears of grief—let him say if his heart
hath ever formed the wish that it had never
shrined within it whom he now deplores. Let
him say if the pleasures of the sweet communion
of his former days doth not still live in
his remembrance. If he love not to recall the
image of the departed, the tones of his voice,
the words of his discourse, the deeds of his
kindness, the amiable virtues of his life! If,
while he weeps the loss of his friend, he smiles
not to think that he once possessed him. He
who knows not friendship, knows not the purest
pleasure of earth. Yet if fate deprive us of
it, though we grieve, we do not sink; Philosophy
is still at hand, and she upholds us with
fortitude. And think, my sons, perhaps in the
very evil we dread, there is a good; perhaps
the very uncertainty of the tenure gives it value
in our eyes; perhaps all our pleasures take
their zest from the known possibility of their
interruption. What were the glories of the
sun, if we knew not the gloom of darkness?
What the refreshing breezes of morning and
evening, if we felt not the fervors of noon?
Should we value the lovely flower, if it bloomed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_126'>126</span>eternally; or the luscious fruit, if it hung
always on the bough? Are not the smiles of
the heavens more beautiful in contrast with
their frowns, and the delights of the seasons
more grateful from their vicissitudes? Let us
then be slow to blame nature, for perhaps in
her apparent errors there is a hidden wisdom.
Let us not quarrel with fate, for perhaps in our
evils lie the seeds of our good. Were our body
never subject to sickness, we might be insensible
to the joy of health. Were our life eternal,
our tranquillity might sink into inaction.
Were our friendship not threatened with interruption,
it might want much of its tenderness.
This, then, my sons, is our duty, for this is our
interest and our happiness: to seek our pleasures
from the hands of the virtues, and for the
pain which may befall us, to submit to it with
patience, or bear up against it with fortitude.
<i>To walk, in short, through life innocently and
tranquilly: and to look on death as its gentle
termination, which it becomes us to meet with
ready minds, neither regretting the past, nor
anxious for the future.</i>”</p>

<p class='c009'>The Sage had scarcely ceased, when a scholar
advanced from the crowd, and bowing his
head with reverence, stooped and touched the
knees of his Master. “Refuse not my homage,”
he said, “nor call the expression of it
<span class='pageno' id='Page_127'>127</span>presumptuous.” Epicurus raised him in his
arms, “Colotes, I am more proud of the homage
of thy young mind, than I should be of that
of the assembled crowd of Olympia. May thy
master, my son, never lose his power over it,
as I feel that he will never abuse it.”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_128'>128</span>
  <h2 class='c006'>CHAPTER XI.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'>The sun had far declined from its meridian,
yet no cool breeze tempered the fervors of the
heat. The air was chained in oppressive stillness,
when suddenly a bustling wind shook the
trees, and a low growling reverberated round
the horizon. The scholars retired before the
threatening storm; but Theon, his ear still
filled with the musical voice of the sage, and
his heart imbued with his gentle precepts, lingered
to feed alone upon the thoughts they had
awakened in him. “How mad is the folly of
man!” he said, as he threw his back against a
tree.—“Professing to admire wisdom and love
virtue, and yet ever persecuting and slandering
both.—How vain is it to look for credit
by teaching truth, or to seek fame by the road
of virtue!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Thy regret is idle, my son,” said a well
known voice in his ear.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh! my guardian spirit!” cried the
startled youth—“Is it you?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I linger,” said the Gargettian, “to watch
the approach of the storm, and I suppose you
do the same.”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_129'>129</span>“No,” returned the youth, “I hardly heeded
the heavens.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“They are singular, however, at this moment.”
Theon looked where the sage pointed;
a dark mass of vapors was piled upon the
head of Hymettus, from which two columns,
shooting forth like the branches of some giant
oak, spread themselves over the sky. The opposing
sun, fast travelling to the horizon, looked
red through the heated atmosphere, and
flashed a deep glare on their murky sides.
Soon half the landscape was blackened with
the sinking clouds, that each moment increasing
in bulk and density, seemed to touch the
bosom of the earth. The western half glowed
with a brilliant light, like molten gold. The
distant outline was marked with a pencil of
fire, while the gardens and villas that speckled
the plaid, seemed illuminated in jubilee.</p>

<p class='c009'>“See,” said the sage, stretching his hand
towards the gilded scene, “see the image of
that fame which is not founded in virtue.
Thus bright may it shine for a moment, but
the cloud of oblivion or infamy comes fast to
cover its glory.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Is it so?” said Theon. “Do not the vile
of the earth fill the tongues of men, and are not
the noble forgotten? Does not the titled murderer
inscribe his name on the tablets of eternity,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_130'>130</span>with the sword which is dipped in the
blood of his fellows?—And does not the man
who hath spent his youth, and manhood, and
age, in the courts of wisdom—who has planted
peace at the hearth, and given truth to the
rising age, does he not go down to the grave in
silence, his bones unhonored, and his name
forgotten?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Possibly his name; but, if he have planted
peace at the hearth, and given truth to the rising
age, surely not his better part—his virtues.
Do not confound noise with fame. The
man who is remembered, is not always honored;
and reflect, what a man toils for, that
probably will he win. The titled murderer,
who weaves his fate with that of empires, will
with them go down to posterity. The sage,
who does his work in the silence of retirement,
unobserved in his own generation, will pass
into the silence of the grave, unknown to the
future.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“But suppose he be known? How few
worshippers crowd to his shrine, and what
millions to that of the other!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“And those few, my son, who are they?
The wise of the earth, the enlightened patriot,
the discerning philosopher. And who are the
millions? The ignorant, the prejudiced, and
the idle. Nor yet, let us so wrong the reason
<span class='pageno' id='Page_131'>131</span>of our species, as to say, that they always give
honor to the mischievous rather than the useful—gratitude
to their oppressors, rather than
their benefactors. In instances they may be
blind, but in the gross they are just. The
splendor of action, the daring of enterprise, or
the glitter of majesty, may seize their imagination,
and so drown their judgment, but never
is it the tyranny of power, the wantonness of
cruelty, the brutality of vice, which they adore,
any more than it is the innocence and usefulness
of virtue, which they despise. The united
experience of mankind has pronounced virtue
to be the great good: nay, so universal is
the conviction, that even those who insult her
in their practice, bow to her in their understanding.
Man is for the most part more fool
than knave, more weak than depraved in action,
more ignorant than vicious in judgment;
and seldom is he so weak and so ignorant, as
not to see his own interest, and value him who
promotes it. But say, that he often slanders
the virtuous, and persecutes the wise; he does
it more in error than from depravity. He is
credulous, and on the report of malice, takes
virtue for hypocrisy:—he is superstitious, and
some of the truths of wisdom appear to him
profane. Say he does homage to vice;—you
will find when he does it, he believes her to be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_132'>132</span>virtue. Hypocrisy has masked her deformity,
or talent decked her with beauty. Is here,
then, subject for wrath? Rather, surely, for
compassion. Is here matter for disgust?
Rather, surely, for exertion. The darker the
ignorance, the more praise to the sage who
dispels it;—the deeper the prejudice, more
fame to the courage which braves it. But
may the courage be vain? May the sage fall
the victim of the ignorance he combats?—He
may; he often has. But ere he engage, knows
he not the risk?—The risk is to himself; the
profit to mankind. To a benevolent soul, the
odds is worth the throw; and though it be
against him at the present, he may win it in
the future. The sage, whose vision is cleared
from the mists of prejudice, can stretch it over
the existing age, to the kindling horizon of the
succeeding, and see, perhaps, unborn generations
weeping the injustice of their fathers, and
worshipping those truths which they condemned.
Or is it otherwise? Lives he in the
old age of the world, and does he see the
stream of time flowing through a soil yet more
rank with prejudice and evil? Say, then,—were
the praise of such a world a fit object of
his ambition, or shall he be jealous of the fame
which ignorance yields to the unworthy? But
any way, my son, it is not the voice of fame
<span class='pageno' id='Page_133'>133</span>that we should seek in the practice of virtue,
but the peace of self-satisfaction. The object
of the sage is to make himself independent of
all that he cannot command within himself.
Yet, when I speak of independence, I mean
not indifference; while we make ourselves sufficient
for ourselves, we need not forget the
crowd about us. We are not wise in the contempt
of others, but in calm approbation of
ourselves.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Still dost thou drop thy head, my son?”
said the gentle philosopher, laying a hand on
the shoulder of his young friend.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Your words sink deep into my soul,” replied
Theon; “yet they have not chased the
melancholy they found there. I have not such
a world in myself as to be independent of that
about me, nor can I forgive the offences of my
fellows, merely because they commit them
from ignorance. Nay, is not their very ignorance
often a crime, when the voice of truth is
whispering in their ear?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“And if they do not hear her whisper in
the one ear, it is because prejudice is crying
aloud into the other.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Prejudice! I hate prejudice,” said Theon.</p>

<p class='c009'>“And so do I,” said the Master.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, but I am provoked with it.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I suspect that will not remove the evil.”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_134'>134</span>“Nothing will remove it. It is inherent in
men’s nature.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Then as we are men, it may be inherent
in ours. Trust me, my son, it is better to correct
ourselves, than to find fault with our
neighbors.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“But is it not allowed to do both? Can we
help seeing the errors of the world in which
we live, and seeing, can we help being angry
at them?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Certainly not the seeing them, but I hope,
very possibly, the being angry with them.
He that loses temper with the folly of others,
shows that he has folly himself. In which
case they have as much right to complain of
his, as he of theirs. And have I not been
trying to show you, that when you are wise
you will be independent of all that you cannot
command within yourself? You say you are
not so now. I admit it, but when you are
wise you will be so. And <i>till</i> you are wise,
you have surely no title to quarrel with another’s
ignorance.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I can never be independent of my friends,”
returned Theon. “I must ever feel the injustice
done to them, though I might be regardless
of that which affected merely myself.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Why so? What would enable you to
disregard that done to yourself?”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_135'>135</span>“Conscious innocence. Pride, if you will.
Contempt of the folly and ignorance of my
judges.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, and are you less conscious of the innocence
of your friend? If you are, where is
your indignation? And if you are not, have
you less pride for him than for yourself? Do
you respect that folly and ignorance in his
judges that you despise in your own?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I believe it will not stand argument,” said
Theon. “But you must forgive me if, when
I contemplate Epicurus, I feel indignant at the
slander which dares to breathe upon his purity.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“And do you think you were yourself an
object of indignation, when you spoke of him
as a monster of vice!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, I feel I was.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“But he felt otherwise,” said the Master,
“and which, think you, is likely to feel most
wisely?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Ah! I hope it is Epicurus,” said the
youth, snatching his instructor’s hand. Their
conversation was here interrupted by the bursting
of the storm. The fire flashed round the
horizon, the thunder cracked over the zenith,
and the first big drops fell from the burdened
clouds. “We are near the Temple,” said the
sage, “let us seek shelter under its portico.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_136'>136</span>We may watch the storm there, without a wet
skin.” They had hardly gained it, when the
rain poured down in torrents. Ilissus, whom
the burning sun had of late faded into a feeble
rill, soon filled and overflowed his bed: wave
after wave, in sudden swell, came roaring
down, as if he now first burst to life from the
womb of his parent mountain. But the violence
of the storm soon spent its strength. Already
the thunder broke with longer intervals,
and a faint light, like the opening of morning,
gleamed over the western heavens. At length
the sun cleared his barrier of clouds. He stood
on the verge of the waves, and shot his level
rays over the blazing Salamis and the glistening
earth. The sage stood with his young
friend in silent admiration, when the eye of the
latter was attracted by a horseman, who came
full gallop over the plain, directly towards
them. The object of his attention had nearly
reached the river, when he perceived the rider
to be a female. The swift feet of the steed
now touched the opposite brink. “Great
Jove! she will not attempt the passage!” exclaimed
the youth, as he sprung towards the
river. “Stop! stop!” he cried. She checked
the rein, but too late. The animal, accustomed
to the passage, and blinded by speed,
plunged into the flood. Theon tore his robe
<span class='pageno' id='Page_137'>137</span>from his shoulders, and was about to make the
plunge on his side, when he was grasped by
Epicurus.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Be not rash. The horse is strong, and the
rider skilful.” The voice that uttered these
words was calm and distinct, but its wonted
music was changed into the deep tone of suppressed
horror. Even at that moment, the
accent struck Theon’s ear.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Do you know her? Is she your friend? Is
she dear to you? If so—,” he made another
effort to throw himself forward, but was still
restrained by Epicurus. He looked into the
philosopher’s face. There was no motion in it,
save a quivering round the mouth, while the
eyes were fixed in aching gaze on the struggling
animal. He breasted the water midway,
when seemingly frightened at the rapidity of
the current, he tried to turn. The rider saw
the danger, she curbed the rein, she tried with
voice and effort to urge him to the conflict.
Theon looked again at the sage. He saw he
had loosened his mantle, and was prepared to
try the flood. “I conjure you, by the gods!”
said the youth, “what is my life to yours?”
He grasped the sage in his turn. “Let me
save her! I will save her—I swear it!”
They both struggled a moment for the leap.
“I swear,” continued Theon, with furious energy,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_138'>138</span>“that if you go, I will follow.” He
made another effort, and dashed from the hold
of Epicurus into the river. Naturally strong,
he was doubly so at this moment. He felt not
fear, he saw not danger. In a moment he
was in the centre of the current—another
stroke, and he had seized the mane of the
steed. But the terrified animal even then
gave way to the stream. The rider still struggled
for her seat. But her strength fast failed,
she stretched out her hand with a feeble cry of
despair. Theon shot forward yet swifter than
the tide; he drove with a shock against the
horse, and caught with one arm the expiring
girl. Then, half yielding to the current, he
parted with the other the roaring waters, and
with effort almost superhuman grappled with
their fury. Panting, choking, bewildered, yet
never relaxing, he reached, but he knew not
how, the land. When he recovered recollection
he found himself lying on a couch, in the
arms of Epicurus. “Where am I,” he said,
“and where is the lovely girl?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Safe, safe, as her generous deliverer. Oh!
my son! now indeed my son, when I owe to
thee my Hedeia.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Was it your adopted child, then?” cried
the youth, with a shout of delirious joy, as he
threw himself on the breast of the sage. “But
<span class='pageno' id='Page_139'>139</span>tell me,” he said, rising and looking round on
Metrodorus, who, with two other scholars,
stood beside the couch, “how came I here?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I believe,” said Metrodorus, “the Master
swam to your aid—at least, we found him
lifting you and Hedeia from the water.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I watched your strength, my son, and reserved
mine till it should fail; when I observed
it to do so, I came to your assistance.
Now, compose yourself awhile, and I will go
and put myself into a dry tunic.”</p>

</div>

<p class='c007'>Theon, rising recruited from the warm bath,
and his limbs being well rubbed with ointments,
joined the party at supper in health and
spirits. It consisted of the Master, Leontium,
Metrodorus, and two other scholars, whose
persons were new to him. There was something
in the gentle manners of one, not unmixed
with a little awkwardness, the grave repose
of his features, the abstract thought that lined
his forehead, and fixed his mild eye, that led
him to guess it was Polyœnus. The other,
whose gait had the dignity of manhood, and
the polish of art; whose face, without being
handsome, had that beauty which refined sentiment
and a well stored mind always throw
more or less into the features; whose whole
appearance showed at once the fine scholar and
the amiable man, fixed instantly Theon’s attention
and curiosity. All received the youth
with congratulations, and Metrodorus, as he
held him in his embrace, jokingly upbraided
him as a greedy and barbarous invader, who
was carrying off, in his single person, the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_141'>141</span>whole love and honor of the Garden. “But
yet,” he added, “have a care; for I doubt you
have secured the envy also.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I believe it,” said Theon. “At least I
know I should envy you, or any of your fraternity,
who had risked his life, aye, or lost it, in
the service of your Master, or any your Master
loved.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well said, my dear youth,” said the
stranger, taking his hand; “and when you
have seen more of the nymph you so gallantly
rescued, you will perhaps think the man a no
less object of envy, who should risk his life
for her, or any she loved.”</p>

<p class='c009'>They moved to the table, when Leontium
whispered Theon, “Hermachus of Mytelene,
the bosom friend of Epicurus.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I thank you,” replied Theon, “you have
well read my curiosity.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The party were about to place themselves,
when a sound in the passage turned all eyes to
the door. “Yes, nurse, you may just peaceably
let me take my own way. Go, go, I am
quite well, quite warm, and quite active. I
tell you, you have rubbed my skin off—would
you rub away my flesh too?” And in came,
with the light foot of a nymph of Dian, the
young Hedeia. A white garment, carelessly
adjusted, fell, with inimitable grace, over her
<span class='pageno' id='Page_142'>142</span>airy form; in equal negligence, her long hair,
still moist from the recent waves, and dishevelled
by the anxious rubbing of her careful attendant,
hung down her shoulders to her zone.
Her face, though pale from late alarm and fatigue,
beaming with life and joy. Her full
dark eyes sparkling with intelligence, and her
lips, though their coral was slightly faded,
lovely with smiles. In one hand she held a
goblet, in the other a chaplet of myrtle.
“Which is my hero?” she asked, in a voice
more sweet than the evening zephyr, as she
looked round the board. “Am I right?” approaching
Theon. The youth, as he gazed on
the lovely face, forgot to answer. “Nay, is it
a statue?” leaning forward, and gazing in her
turn, as if in curious inspection.</p>

<p class='c009'>“No, a slave,” said Theon, half smiling,
half blushing, as he stooped his knee, while
she placed the garland on his head.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I come to pledge you,” she said, putting
the cup to her lips, “and to bid you pledge
me,” presenting it with bewitching grace to
the youth. He took it in speechless ecstasy
from her taper fingers, and turning that side
to his mouth which had received the touch of
her’s, quaffed off at once the draught of wine
and love.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Beware,” said a voice in his ear; “it is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_143'>143</span>the cup of Circe.” He turned, Polyœnus stood
behind him; but when he saw his motionless
features, he could hardly believe the whisper
had been uttered by him.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I know,” continued the fair one, pointing
to the table, “there is but cold beverage here
for a drowned man. My wise father may
know to give comfort to the mind, but come to
my good nurse, when you want the comfort of
the body. She is the most skilful compounder
of elixirs, philters, and every palatable medicine
that you might haply find in all Greece,
all Asia, aye, or all the earth. And now make
way,” putting back the surrounding company,
and leading Theon by the arm to the upper
end of the table. “Behold the king of the
feast.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“That is, if you are the queen,” said the intoxicated
youth.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh! certainly,” placing herself by his side,
“I never refuse consequence, whenever I can
get it.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Wherever you can take it, you mean,”
said the Master laughing.</p>

<p class='c009'>“And is not that every where?” said Hermachus,
bowing to the fair girl.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, I believe it is. A pretty face, my
friends, may presume much; a willful nature
<span class='pageno' id='Page_144'>144</span>may carry all things. I have both to perfection;
have I not?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Praise to Venus, and the Graces!” said
Leontium; “our sister has brought a heart as
gay from the college of Pythagoras, as she
took into it.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“To be sure; and did you expect otherwise?
Psha! you philosophers know nothing
of human nature. I could have told you before
this last experiment, that humor lies in
contrast, and that a wag will find more subject
in a synod of grave sages than a crew of
laughing wits. You must know,” turning to
Theon, “I have been on a visit to a wise man,
a <i>very</i> wise man, who has followed from his
youth up the whim, and all very wise men
have whims, of restoring the neglected school
of Pythagoras to its pristine greatness. Accordingly,
he has collected and brought up
some dozen submissive youths to his full satisfaction;
for not one of them dare know his
right hand from his left, but on his master’s
authority, doubly backed by that of the great
founder. They have, in short, no purse of
their own, no time of their own, no tongue of
their own, no will of their own, and no
thought of their own. You cannot conceive a
more perfect community. One more virtuously
<span class='pageno' id='Page_145'>145</span>insipid, more scientifically absurd, or
more wisely ignorant.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Fie, fie, you giddy jade,” said the Master,
smiling, while he tried to frown.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Giddy, not at all. I am delivering grave
matter of fact story.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“And we are all ear,” said Hermachus, “so
pray let us have the whole of it.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“The whole? nay, you have it already.
An abode of the blessed; a house with twelve
bodies in it, and one brain to serve them all.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Why,” replied Hermachus, “I believe you
have at home some hundred bodies in the same
predicament.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“To be sure; and so I told the sage Pythagorean,
when he looked so complacently on
his twelve pieces of mechanism, and assured
him that were it not for me, there would not
be a single original in the Garden save the
Master. I assure you, father, I gave just as
matter of fact a description of your household,
as I now do of the old Pythagorean’s. And, a
most singular coincidence, I remember he
cried, ‘Fie, fie,’ just as you did now. Once
more, it was a most perfect household; with
the men, all peace, method, virtue, learning,
and absurdity: with the women, all silence,
order, ignorance, modesty, and stupidity.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“And pray, sister,” said Metrodorus, “what
<span class='pageno' id='Page_146'>146</span>made you leave a society that afforded such
food to your satire?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Because, brother, the richest food cloys the
fastest. I passed three days to my perfect satisfaction;
a fourth would have killed me.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“And your friends, too,” said the philosopher,
shaking his head.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Killed them? They never knew they had
life, till I found it out for them. No, no, I left
sore hearts behind me. The Master indeed,—ah!
the Master!—Poor man, shall I confess
it? Before I left the house, he caught one of
his pupils looking into a mirror with a candle,
heard that another had stirred the fire with a
sword, and oh! more dreadful than all, that a
third had swallowed a bean.<a id='r3'></a><a href='#f3' class='c008'><sup>[3]</sup></a> If I could have
staid three days longer, I might have wound
my girdle round the necks of the whole dozen,
brought them on my back, and laid them at
the feet of Epicurus.”</p>

<div class='footnote' id='f3'>
<p class='c009'><a href='#r3'>3</a>. Alluding to the whimsical superstitions of Pythagoras,
or, perhaps it were more just to say, of his followers.</p>
</div>

<p class='c009'>“And what said the Master all this time?”
said Leontium.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Said he? what said he? umph! I never
heard what he said, for I was reading what he
felt.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“And what felt he?” asked Hermachus.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_147'>147</span>“Just what <i>you</i> have felt—and you too,”
looking at Polyœnus. “Aye, and you also,
very sage philosopher;” and turning short
round to Theon, “what you have to feel, if
you have to feel, if you have not yet felt—that
I was vastly witty, vastly amusing, and
vastly beautiful.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“And do you think,” said the Gargettian,
“when we feel all this, we can’t be angry with
you?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Nay, what do <i>you</i> think? But no, no, I
know you all better than you know yourselves.
And I think you <i>cannot</i>, or if you <i>can</i>, ’tis as
the poet, who curses the muse he burns to propitiate.
Oh! philosophy! philosophy! thou
usest hard maxims and showest a grave face,
yet thy maxims are but words, and thy face
but a mask. A skilful histrion, who, when
the buskin is off, paint, plaster, and garment
thrown aside, stands no higher, no fairer, and
no more mighty, than the youngest, poorest,
and simplest of thy gaping worshippers. Ah!
friends! laugh and frown; but show me the
man, the wisest, the gravest, or the sourest,
that a bright pair of eyes can’t make a fool of.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Ah! you proud girl,” said Hermachus,
“tremble! remember the blue-eyed Sappho
died at last for a Phaon.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, if such be my fate, I must submit.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_148'>148</span>I do not deny, because I have been wise hitherto,
that I may not turn fool with the philosophers,
before I die.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“What an excellent school for the rearing of
youth,” said the Master, “the old Pythagorean
must think mine.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Judging from me as a specimen, you mean.
And trust me now, father, I am the best. Do
I not practise what you preach? What you
show the way to, do I not possess? Look at
my light foot, look in my laughing eye, read
my gay heart, and tell—if pleasure be not
mine. Confess then, that I take a shorter cut
to the goal than your wiser scholars, aye, than
your wisest self. You study, you lecture, you
argue, you exhort. And what is it all for? as
if you could not be good without so much
learning, and happy without so much talking.
Here am I—I think I am very good, and I
am quite sure I am very happy; yet I never
wrote a treatise in my life, and can hardly listen
to one without a yawn.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Theon,” said Epicurus, smiling, “you see
now the priestess of our midnight orgies.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Ah! poor youth, you must have found the
Garden but a dull place in my absence. But
have patience, it will be better in future.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“More dangerous,” said Polyœnus.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Never mind him,” whispered Hedeia, in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_149'>149</span>the Corinthian’s ear,—“he is not the grave
man that a bright pair of eyes cannot make a
fool of. This is very odd,” she continued,
looking round the board. “Here am I, the
stranger, and one too half drowned, charged
with the entertaining of this whole learned
society.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Nay, my girl,” said the Master, “thou
hadst need to be whole drowned, ere your
friends might secure the happiness of being
listened to.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Indeed, I believe it’s true; and considering
that the greatest pleasure of life is the being
listened to, I wonder how any one was
found to pick me out of the water. The Corinthian,
to be sure, did not know what he
saved; but that the Master should wet his
tunic in my service, is a very unaccountable
circumstance. Is there any reason for it in
philosophy?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I am afraid none.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Or in mathematics?” turning to Polyœnus.
“Now, just see there a proof of my argument.
Can any man look more like wisdom,
or less like happiness? This comes of
diagrams and ethics. My young Corinthian,
take warning.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I wish we could fix you to a diagram,”
said Leontium.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_150'>150</span>“The Graces forfend! and why should you
wish it? Think you it would make me
wiser? Let Polyœnus be judge, if I am not
wiser than he. I admire the different prescriptions
that are given by different doctors.
The wife of the good Pythagorean recommended
me a distaff.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well,” said Hermachus, “that might do
equally.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Pray, why don’t you take one yourself?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I, you see, am busy with philosophy.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“And so am I, with laughing at it. Ah!
my sage brother, every man thinks <i>that</i> perfection,
that he is himself—<i>that</i> the only knowledge
that he possesses—and <i>that</i> the only
pleasure that he pursues. Trust me, there
are as many ways of living as there are men,
and one is no more fit to lead another, than a
bird to lead a fish, or a fish a quadruped.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“You would make a strange world, were
you the queen of it,” said Hermachus, laughing.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Just as strange, and no stranger than it is
at present. For why? I should take it as I
found it, and leave it as I found it. ’Tis you
philosophers, who would rub and twist, and
plague and doctor it, and fret your souls out, to
bring all its heterogeneous parts, fools, wits,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_151'>151</span>knaves, simpletons, grave, gay, light, heavy,
long faced and short faced, black, white,
brown, straight and crooked, tall, short, thin
and fat, to fit together, and patient reflect each
other, like the acorns of an oak, or the modest
wives and helpless daughters of the good citizens
of Athens; ’tis you, I say, who would
make a strange world, were you kings of it—you
would shorten and lengthen, clip, pull,
and carve men’s minds to fit your systems, as
the tyrant did men’s bodies to fit his bed.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I grant there’s some truth, my girl, in thy
nonsense,” said the Master.</p>

<p class='c009'>“And I grant that there is not a philosopher
in Athens, who would have granted as much,
save thyself. You will find, my young hero,”
turning to Theon, “that my father philosophises
more sense, that is, less absurdity, than any
man since the seven sages, nay! even than the
seven sages philosophized themselves. He
only lacks to be a perfectly wise man——”</p>

<p class='c009'>“To burn,” said the Master, “his books of
philosophy, and to sing a tune to thy lyre.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“No, it shall do to let me sing a tune to it
myself.” She bounded from the couch and
the room, and returned in a moment, with the
instrument in her hand. “Fear not,” she
said, nodding to the sage, as she lightly swept
<span class='pageno' id='Page_152'>152</span>the chords, “I shall not woo my own lover,
but your mistress.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“No thanks, no thanks. I shall take my
own reward,” and stealing behind Epicurus,
she threw her white arms round his neck, and
laid her cheek on his lips. Then rising,
“Good dreams be with you!” and waving
round her hand, and throwing a smile on
Theon, vanished in an instant. The youth
saw and heard no more, but sat as in a dream,
until the party divided.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Have a care,” whispered the Master, as he
followed him into the vestibule. “Cupid is a
knavish god, he can pierce the hearts of others,
and hold a shield before his own.”</p>

<div class='chapter'>

  <h2 class='c006'>CHAPTER XIII.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Night’s refreshing airs fanned the cheeks of
Theon, and rustled the myrtle on his brow;
but the subtle fever of love which swept
through his veins, and throbbed in his heart
and temples, was beyond their cooling influence.
The noisy business of life had now given
place in the streets to noisy merriment. The
song and the dance sounded from the open
portals; and the young votaries of Bacchus, in
all the frenzy of the god, rushed from the
evening banquet, to the haunts of midnight
excess, while the trembling lover glided past to
the stolen interview, shrinking even from the
light of Day’s pale sister. Theon turned abruptly
from the crowd, and sought instinctively
a public walk, at this hour always private,
where he had often mused on the mysteries of
philosophy, and taxed his immature judgment
to hold the balance between the doctrines of
her contending schools. No thoughts so deep
and high now filled his youthful fancy. He
wandered on, his senses steeped in delirium
not less potent than that of wine, until his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_154'>154</span>steps were suddenly arrested by a somewhat
rude encounter  with a human figure, advancing
with a pace more deliberate than his own.
He started backwards and his eyes met those
of Cleanthes. The stoic paused a moment,
then moved to pass on. But Theon, however
little he might have desired such a companion
at such a moment, hailed him by name, and
placed himself at his side. Again Cleanthes
gazed on him in silence; when Theon, following
the direction of his glance, raised a hand
to his temples, and removed, with a conscious
blush, the offending garland. He held it for a
moment; then, placing it in his bosom—“You
misjudge this innocent token;—a
pledge of acknowledgment for a life redeemed
from the waves.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Would that I might receive a pledge of the
redemption of thy virtue, Theon, from the
flood of destruction! For thy sake I have
opened the volumes of this smooth deceiver.
And shall a few fair words and a fairer countenance
shield such doctrines from opprobrium?
Shall he who robs virtue of her sublimity, the
Gods of their power, man of his immortality,
and creation of its providence, pass for a
teacher of truth, and expounder of the laws of
nature? Where is thy reason, Theon? where
thy moral sense? to see, in doctrines such as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_155'>155</span>these, aught but impiety and crime, or to imagine,
that he, who advocates them, can merit
aught but the scorn of the wise, and the opprobrium
of the good?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I know not such to be the doctrines of Epicurus,”
said the youth, “and you will excuse
my farther reply, until I shall have examined
the philosophy you so bitterly, and apparently
so justly condemn.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“The philosophy? honor it not with the
name.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Nay,” returned Theon with a smile,
“there are so many absurdities honored with
that appellative, in Athens, that the compliment
might pass unchallenged, although applied
to one less worthy than, in my eyes, appears
the sage of Gargettium. But,” preventing
the angry interruption of the stoic, “my
slowness to judge and to censure offends your
enthusiasm. The experience of three days
has taught me this caution. My acquaintance,
as yet, is rather with the philosopher than the
philosophy; my prejudices at first were equally
strong against both. Having discovered
my error with respect to one, ought I not to
read, listen, and examine, before I condemn
the other? And, the rather, as all that I have
heard in the garden has hitherto convinced my
reason, and awakened my admiration and
love.”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_156'>156</span>“Permit me the question,” said Cleanthes,
stopping short, and fixing his piercing glance
on the countenance of his companion—“Honor
ye the Gods, and believe ye in a creating
cause, and a superintending Providence?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Surely I do,” said Theon.</p>

<p class='c009'>“How, then, venerate ye the man who proclaims
his doubt of both?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“So, in my hearing, has never the son of
Neocles.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“But he has and does in the hearing of the
world.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I have so heard, and ranked it among the
libels of his enemies.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“He has so written, and the fact is acknowledged
by his friends.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I will read his works,” said Theon, “and
question the writer. A mind more candid,
whatever be its errors, exists not, I am persuaded,
than that of Epicurus; I should have
said also, a mind more free of errors. But
he has taught me to think no mind, however
wise, infallible.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Call ye such doctrines, errors? I should
rather term them crimes.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I object not to the word,” said Theon. “I
will examine into this. The Gods have ye in
their keeping! Good night.” They entered
the city, and the friends divided.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_157'>157</span>
  <h2 class='c006'>CHAPTER XIV.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Uneasy thoughts bred unquiet slumbers;
and Theon rose from a restless couch, before
the first blush of Aurora tinged the forehead of
the sky. He trod the paths of the garden, and
waited with impatience, for the first time not
unmixed with apprehension, the appearance of
the Master. The assertions of Cleanthes were
corroborated by the testimony of the public;
but that testimony he had learned to despise.
They were made after perusal of Epicurus’s
writings; with these writings he was still unacquainted.
Had they been misinterpreted?
Cleanthes was no Timocrates. If prejudiced,
he was incapable of wilful misrepresentation;
and he was too familiar with the science of
philosophy, so grossly to misunderstand a reasoner,
as lucid as appeared to be Epicurus.
These musings were soon interrupted. The
morning star still glowed in the kindling east,
when he heard approaching footsteps, and
turning from the shades upon a small open
lawn where a crystal fountain flowed from the
inverted urn of a recumbent naiad, he was
greeted by the Sage.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_158'>158</span>“Oh! no,” exclaimed Theon, half audibly,
as he gazed on the serene countenance before
him, “this man is not an atheist.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“What thoughts are with you, my son, this
morning?” said the philosopher, with kind solicitude.
“I doubt your plunge in Ilyssus disturbed
your dreams. Did the image of a fair
nymph, or of a river god flit round your
couch, and drive sleep from your eyelids?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I was in some danger from the first,” said
the youth, half smiling, half blushing, “until
a visitant of a different character, and one, I
imagine, more wont to soothe than to disturb
the mind, brought to my imagination a host of
doubts and fears, which your presence alone
has dispelled.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“And who played the part of your incubus?”
demanded the Sage.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Even yourself, most benign and indulgent
of men.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Truly, I grieve to have acted so ill by thee,
my son. It shall be well, however, if having
inflicted the disease, I may be its physician.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“On leaving you last night,” said Theon,
“I encountered Cleanthes. He came from the
perusal of your writings, and brought charges
against them which I was unprepared to answer.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Let us hear them, my son; perhaps, until
<span class='pageno' id='Page_159'>159</span>you shall have perused them yourself, we may
assist your difficulty.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“First, that they deny the existence of the
Gods.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I see but one other assertion, that could
equal that in folly,” said Epicurus.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I knew it!” exclaimed Theon, triumphantly;
“I knew it was impossible. But where
will not prejudice lead men, when even the
upright Cleanthes is capable of slander?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“He is utterly incapable of it,” said the
Master; “and the inaccuracy, in this case, I
rather suspect to rest with you than with him.
To <i>deny</i> the existence of the Gods would indeed
be presumption in a philosopher; a presumption
equalled only by that of him who should
<i>assert</i> their existence.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“How!” exclaimed the youth, with a countenance
in which astonishment seemed to suspend
every other expression.</p>

<p class='c009'>“As I never saw the Gods, my son,” calmly
continued the Sage, “I cannot <i>assert</i> their existence;
and, that I never saw them, is no
reason for my <i>denying</i> it.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“But do we believe nothing except that of
which we have ocular demonstration?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Nothing, at least, for which we have not
the evidence of one or more of our senses; that
is, when we believe on just grounds, which, I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_160'>160</span>grant, taking men collectively, is very seldom.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“But where would this spirit lead us? To
impiety!—to Atheism!—to all, against which
I felt confidence in defending the character
and philosophy of Epicurus!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“We will examine presently, my son, into
the meaning of the terms you have employed.
But as respects your defence of my philosophy,
I am sorry that you presumed so much, where
you knew so little. Let this serve for another
caution against pronouncing before you examine,
and asserting before you enquire. It is
my usual custom,” continued the Master,
“with the youth who frequent my School, to
defer the discussion of all important questions,
until they are naturally, in the course of
events, suggested to their own minds. Their
curiosity once excited, it is my endeavor, so
far as in me lies, to satisfy it. When you first
entered the Garden, your mind was unfit for
the examination of the subject you have now
started: it is no longer so; and we will therefore
enter upon the enquiry, and pursue it in
order.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Forgive me if I express—if I acknowledge,”
said the youth, slightly recoiling from
his instructor, “some reluctance to enter on
<span class='pageno' id='Page_161'>161</span>the discussion of truths, whose very discussion
would seem to argue a doubt,—and—”</p>

<p class='c009'>“And what then?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“That very doubt were a crime.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“It is there that I wished to lead you; and
with the examination of this point we shall
rest, until time and circumstances lead you to
push the investigation farther. I have in me
little of the spirit of proselytism. A mere abstract
opinion, supposing it not to affect the
conduct or disposition of him who holds it,
would be in my eyes of very minor importance.
And it is only in so far as I believe
that all our opinions, however apparently removed
from any practical consequences, do always
more or less affect one or the other—our
conduct or our dispositions—that I am at
the pains to correct in my scholars, those
which appear to me erroneous. I understand
you to say, that to enter upon the discussion of
certain opinions, which you consider as sacred
truths, would appear to argue a doubt of those
truths, and that a doubt would here constitute
a crime. Now as I think such a belief inconsistent
with candor and charity—two feelings,
indispensable both for the enjoyment of happiness
ourselves, and for its distribution to others,
I shall challenge its investigation. If the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_162'>162</span>doubt of any truth shall constitute a crime,
then the belief of the same truth should constitute
a virtue.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Perhaps a duty would rather express it.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“When you charge the neglect of any duty
as a crime, or account its fulfilment a virtue,
you suppose the existence of a power to neglect
or fulfil; and it is the exercise of this power,
in the one way or the other, which constitutes
the merit or demerit. Is it not so?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Certainly.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Does the human mind possess the power
to believe or disbelieve, at pleasure, any truths
whatsoever?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I am not prepared to answer: but I think
it does, since it possesses always the power of
investigation.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“But, possibly, not the will to exercise the
power. Take care lest I beat you with your
own weapons. I thought this very investigation
appeared to you a crime.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Your logic is too subtle,” said the youth,
“for my inexperience.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Say rather, my reasoning too close. Did I
bear you down with sounding words and
weighty authorities, and confound your understanding
with hair-drawn distinctions, you
would be right to retreat from the battery.”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_163'>163</span>“I have nothing to object to the fairness of
your deductions,” said Theon. “But would
not the doctrine be dangerous that should establish
our inability to help our belief; and
might we not stretch the principle, until we asserted
our inability to help our actions?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“We might and with reason. But we will
not now traverse the ethical <i><span lang="la">pons asinorum</span></i> of
necessity—the most simple and evident of
moral truths, and the most darkened, tortured,
and belabored by moral teachers. You
enquire if the doctrine we have essayed to establish,
be not dangerous. I reply—not, if it
be true. Nothing is so dangerous as error,—nothing
so safe as truth. A dangerous truth
would be a contradiction in terms, an anomaly
in things.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“But what is a truth?” said Theon.</p>

<p class='c009'>“It is pertinently asked. A truth I consider
to be an ascertained fact; which truth would
be changed into an error, the moment the fact,
on which it rested, was disproved.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I see, then, no fixed basis for truth.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“It surely has the most fixed of all—the
nature of things. And it is only an imperfect
insight into that nature, which occasions all
our erroneous conclusions, whether in physics
or morals.”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_164'>164</span>“But where, if we discard the gods, and
their will, as engraven on our hearts, are our
guides in the search after truth?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Our senses, and our faculties as developed
in and by the exercise of our senses, are the
only guides with which I am acquainted.
And I do not see why, even admitting a belief
in the gods, and in a superintending providence,
the senses should not be viewed as the
guides, provided by them, for our direction and
instruction. But here is the evil attendant on
an ungrounded belief, whatever be its nature.
The moment we take one thing for granted we
take other things for granted: we are started
in a wrong road, and it is seldom we can gain
the right one, until we have trodden back our
steps to the starting place. I know of but one
thing, that a philosopher should take for granted;
and that only because he is forced to do it
by an irresistible impulse of his nature; and
because, without doing so, neither truth nor
falsehood could exist for him. He must take
for granted the evidence of his senses; in other
words, he must believe in the existence of
things, as they exist to his senses. I <i>know</i>
of no other existence, and can therefore <i>believe</i>
in no other; although, reasoning from analogy,
I may <i>imagine</i> other existences to be.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_165'>165</span>This, for instance, I do as respects the gods.
I see around me in the world I inhabit an infinite
variety in the arrangement of matter;—a
multitude of sentient beings, possessing different
kinds, and varying grades of power and
intelligence,—from the worm that crawls in
the dust, to the eagle that soars to the sun,
and man who marks to the sun its course. It
is possible, it is moreover probable, that, in the
worlds which I see not,—in the boundless infinitude
and eternal duration of matter, beings
may exist, of every countless variety, and
varying grades of intelligence, inferior and superior
to our own, until we descend to a minimum,
and rise to a maximum, to which the
range of our observation affords no parallel,
and of which our senses are inadequate to the
conception. Thus far, my young friend, I believe
in the gods, or in what you will of existences
removed from the sphere of my knowledge.
That you should believe, with positiveness,
in one unseen existence or another, appears
to me no crime, although it may appear
to me unreasonable: and so, my doubt of the
same should appear to you no moral offence,
although you might account it erroneous. I
fear to fatigue your attention, and will, therefore,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_166'>166</span>dismiss, for the present, these abstruse
subjects.</p>

<p class='c009'>“But we shall both be amply repaid for their
discussion, if this truth remain with you—that
an opinion, right or wrong, can never constitute
a moral offence, nor be in itself a moral
obligation. It may be mistaken; it may involve
an absurdity, or a contradiction. It is a
truth; or it is an error: it can never be a
crime or a virtue.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Theon remained transfixed to the same spot
of earth on which the Sage left him. A confused
train of thoughts travelled through his
brain, which his reason sought in vain to arrest,
or to analyze. At one moment it seemed
as if a ray of light had dawned upon his mind,
opening to it a world of discovery as interesting
as it was novel. Then suddenly he started
as from the brink of a precipice, whose
depths were concealed in darkness. “Cleanthes
then had justly expounded the doctrines
of the garden.—But did these doctrines involve
the delinquency which he had hitherto
supposed? Were they inconsistent with reason,
and irreconcilable with virtue? If so, I
shall be able to detect their fallacy,” said the
youth, pursuing his soliloquy aloud. “It
were a poor compliment to the truths I have
hitherto worshipped, did I shrink from their
investigation. And yet, to question the power
of the Gods! To question their very existence!
To refuse the knee of homage to that
great first cause of all things, that speaks, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_168'>168</span>breathes, and shines resplendent throughout all
animated nature! To dispute I know not
what—of truths, as self-evident as they are
sacred; which speak to our eyes and our ears;
to those very senses whose testimony alone is
without appeal in the garden!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Do you object to the testimony, young
Corinthian?” said a voice, which Theon recognised
as that of Metrodorus.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You arrive opportunely,” said Theon;
“that is, if you will listen to the questions of
my doubting and embarrassed mind.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Say rather, if I can answer them.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I attribute to you the ability,” said Theon,
“since I have heard you quoted as an able expounder
of the philosophy of the garden.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“In the absence of our Zeno,” said the
scholar with a smile, “I sometimes play the
part of his Cleanthes. And though you may
find me less eloquent than my brother of the
porch, I will promise equal fidelity to the text
of my original. But here is one, who can expound
the doctrine in the letter and the spirit;
and, with such an assistant, I should not fear
to engage all the scholars and all the masters
in Athens.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Nay, boast rather of thy cause than of thy
assistant,” said Leontium, approaching, and
playfully tapping the shoulder of Metrodorus;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_169'>169</span>“nor yet belie thy own talents, my brother.
The Corinthian will smile at thy false modesty,
when he shall have studied thy writings,
and listened to thy logical discourses. I imagine,”
she continued, turning her placid gaze on
the youth, “that you have hitherto listened to
more declamation than reasoning. I might
also say, to more sophistry, seeing that you
have walked and talked in the Lyceum.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Say rather, walked and listened.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“In truth and I believe it,” she returned
with a smile, “and would that your good
sense in this were more common; and that
men would rest content with straining their
ears, and forbear from submitting their understandings,
or torturing those of their neighbors.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“It might seem strange,” said Metrodorus,
“that the pedantry of Aristotle should find so
many imitators, and his dark sayings so many
believers, in a city, too, now graced and enlightened
by the simple language, and simple
doctrines of an Epicurus.—But the language
of truth is too simple for inexperienced ears.
We start in search of knowledge, like the
demi-gods of old in search of adventure, prepared
to encounter giants, to scale mountains,
to pierce into Tartarean gulfs, and to carry off
our prize from the gripe of some dark enchanter,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_170'>170</span>invulnerable to all save to charmed weapons
and deity-gifted assailants. To find none
of all these things, but, in their stead, a
smooth road through a pleasant country, with
a familiar guide to direct our curiosity, and
point out the beauties of the landscape, disappoints
us of all exploit and all notoriety; and
our vanity turns but too often from the fair
and open champaign, into error’s dark labyrinths,
where we mistake mystery for wisdom,
pedantry for knowledge, and prejudice for virtue.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I admit the truth of the metaphor,” said
Theon. “But may we not simplify too much
as well as too little? May we not push investigation
beyond the limits assigned to human
reason, and, with a boldness approaching to
profanity, tear, without removing, the veil
which enwraps the mysteries of creation from
our scrutiny?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Without challenging the meaning of the
terms you have employed,” said Metrodorus,
“I would observe, that there is little danger
of our pushing investigation too far. Unhappily
the limits prescribed to us by our few
and imperfect senses must ever cramp the
sphere of our observation, as compared to the
boundless range of things; and that, even
when we shall have strained and improved our
<span class='pageno' id='Page_171'>171</span>senses to the uttermost. We trace an effect to
a cause, and that cause to another cause, and
so on, till we hold some few links of a chain,
whose extent, like the charmed circle, is without
beginning as without end.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I apprehend the difficulties,” observed Leontium,
“which embraces the mind of our
young friend. Like most aspirants after
knowledge, he has a vague and incorrect
idea of what he is pursuing, and still more,
of what may be attained. In the schools
you have hitherto frequented,” she continued,
addressing the youth, “certain images
of virtue, vice, truth, knowledge, are presented
to the imagination, and these abstract
qualities, or we may call them, figurative
beings, are made at once the objects of speculation
and adoration. A law is laid down,
and the feelings and opinions of men are predicated
upon it; a theory is built, and all animate
and inanimate nature is made to speak
in its support; an hypothesis is advanced, and
all the mysteries of nature are treated as explained.
You have heard of, and studied various
systems of philosophy; but real philosophy
is opposed to all systems. Her whole
business is observation; and the results of that
observation constitute all her knowledge. She
receives no truths, until she has tested them by
<span class='pageno' id='Page_172'>172</span>experience; she advances no opinions, unsupported
by the testimony of facts; she acknowledges
no virtue, but that involved in beneficial
actions; no vice, but that involved in actions
hurtful to ourselves or to others. Above all,
she advances no dogmas,—is slow to assert
what is,—and calls nothing impossible. The
science of philosophy is simply a science of observation,
both as regards the world without
us, and the world within; and, to advance in
it, are requisite only sound senses, well developed
and exercised faculties, and a mind free
of prejudice. The objects she has in view, as
regards the external world, are, first, to see
things as they are, and secondly, to examine
their structure, to ascertain their properties,
and to observe their relations one to the other.—As
respects the world within, or the philosophy
of mind, she has in view, first, to examine
our sensations, or the impressions of external
things on our senses; which operation involves,
and is involved in, the examination of
those external things themselves: secondly, to
trace back to our sensations, the first development
of all our faculties; and again, from
these sensations, and the exercise of our different
faculties as developed by them, to trace the
gradual formation of our moral feelings, and
of all our emotions: thirdly, to analyze all
<span class='pageno' id='Page_173'>173</span>these our sensations, thoughts, and emotions,—that
is, to examine the qualities of our
own internal, sentient matter, with the same,
and yet more, closeness of scrutiny, than we
have applied to the examination of the matter
that is without us: finally, to investigate the
justness of our moral feelings, and to weigh
the merit and demerit of human actions;
which is, in other words, to judge of their tendency
to produce good or evil,—to excite
pleasurable or painful feelings in ourselves or
others. You will observe, therefore, that, both
as regards the philosophy of physics, and the
philosophy of mind, all is simply a process of
investigation. It is a journey of discovery, in
which, in the one case, we commission our
senses to examine the qualities of that matter
which is around us, and in the other, endeavor,
by attention to the varieties of our consciousness,
to gain a knowledge of those qualities
of matter, which constitute our susceptibilities
of thought and feeling.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“This explanation is new to me,” observed
Theon, “and, I will confess, startling to my
imagination. It is pure materialism!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“You may so call it,” rejoined Leontium,
“but, when you have so called it—what
then? The question remains: is it true? or
is it false?”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_174'>174</span>“I should be disposed to say—false, since
it confounds all my preconceived notions of
truth and error, of right and wrong.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Of truth and error, of right and wrong, in
the sense of <i>correct</i> or <i>incorrect</i> is, I presume,
your meaning,” said Leontium. “You do
not involve moral rectitude or the contrary, in
a matter of opinion?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“If the opinion have a moral or immoral
tendency I do,” said the youth.</p>

<p class='c009'>“A simple matter of fact can have no such
tendency, or ought not, if we are rational creatures.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“And would not, if we were always reasoning
beings,” said Metrodorus; “but as the
ignorance and superstition which surround our
infancy and youth, favor the development of
the imagination at the expense of the judgment,
we are ever employed in the coining of
chimeras, rather than in the discovery of
truths; and if ever the poor judgment make
an effort to dispel these fancies of the brain,
she is repulsed, like a sacrilegious intruder into
religious mysteries.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Until our opinions are made to rest on
facts,” said Leontium, “the error of our
young friend—the most dangerous of all errors,
being one of principle and involving
many—must ever pervade the world. And it
<span class='pageno' id='Page_175'>175</span>was because I suspected this leading misconception
of the very nature—of the very end
and aim of the science he is pursuing, that I
attempted an explanation of what should be
sought, and of what can alone be attained.
In philosophy—that is, in knowledge—enquiry
is every thing: theory and hypothesis
are worse than nothing. Truth is but approved
facts. Truth, then, is one with the knowledge
of these facts. To shrink from enquiry,
is to shrink from knowledge. And to prejudge
an opinion as true or false, because it interferes
with some preconceived abstraction we
call vice or virtue, is as if we were to draw the
picture of a man we had never seen, and then,
upon seeing him, were to dispute his being the
man in question, because unlike our picture.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“But if this opinion interfered with another,
of whose truth we imagined ourselves certain?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Then clearly, in one or the other, we are
mistaken; and the only way to settle the difficulty,
is to examine and compare the evidences
of both.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“But are there not some truths self-evident?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“There are a few which we may so call.
That is to say, there are some facts, which we
admit upon the evidence of a simple sensation;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_176'>176</span>as, for instance, that a whole is greater than
its part; that two are more than one: which
we receive immediately upon the testimony of
our sense of sight or of touch.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“But are there no moral truths of the same
nature?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I am not aware of any. Moral truth,
resting entirely upon the ascertained consequences
of actions, supposes a process of observation
and reasoning.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“What call you, then, a belief in a presiding
providence, and a great first cause?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“A belief resting upon testimony; which
belief will be true or false, according to the
correctness or incorrectness of that testimony.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Is it not rather a self-evident moral
truth?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“In my answer, I shall have to divide your
question into two. First, it cannot be a moral
truth, since it is not deduced from the consequences
of human action. It can be simply a
truth, that is, a fact. Secondly, it is not a
self-evident truth, since it is not evident to all
minds, and frequently becomes less and less
evident, the more it is examined.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“But is not the existence of a first or creating
cause demonstrated to our senses, by all
we see, and hear, and feel?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“The existence of all that we see and hear
<span class='pageno' id='Page_177'>177</span>and feel is demonstrated to our senses; and the
belief we yield to this existence is immediate
and irresistible, that is, intuitive.—The existence
of the creating cause, that you speak of,
is not demonstrated to our senses; and therefore
the belief in it cannot be immediate and
irresistible. I prefer the expression ‘creating’
to ‘first’ cause, because it seems to present a
more intelligible meaning. When you shall
have examined farther into the phenomena of
nature, you will see, that there can be as little
a <i>first</i> as a <i>last</i> cause.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“But there must be always a cause, producing
an effect?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Certainly; and so your cause,—creating
all that we see and hear and feel—must itself
have a producing cause, otherwise you are in
the same difficulty as before.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I suppose it a Being unchangeable and
eternal, itself unproduced, and producing all
things.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Unchangeable it <i>may</i> be,—eternal it <i>must</i>
be—since every thing is eternal.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Every thing eternal?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes; that is, the elements composing all
substances are, so far as we know and can
reason, eternal, and in their nature unchangeable;
and it is apparently only the different disposition
of these eternal and unchangeable
<span class='pageno' id='Page_178'>178</span>atoms that produces all the varieties in the
substances constituting the great material
whole, of which we form a part. Those particles,
whose peculiar agglomeration or arrangement,
we call a vegetable to-day, pass
into, and form part of, an animal to-morrow;
and that animal again, by the falling asunder
of its constituent atoms, and the different approximation
and agglomeration of the same,—or,
of the same with other atoms,—is transformed
into some other substance presenting a
new assemblage of qualities. To this simple
exposition of the phenomena of nature (which,
you will observe, is not <i>explaining</i> their wonders,
for that is impossible, but only <i>observing</i>
them,) we are led by the exercise of our senses.
In studying the existences which surround
us, it is clearly our business to use our
eyes, and not our imaginations. To see things
as they are, is all we should attempt, and is
all that is possible to be done. Unfortunately,
we can do but little even here, as our eyes
serve us to see but a very little way. But,
were our eyes better—were they so good as to
enable us to observe all the arcana of matter,
we could never acquire any other knowledge
of them, than that they are as they are;—and,
in knowing this, that is, in seeing every
link in the chain of occurrences, we should
<span class='pageno' id='Page_179'>179</span>know all that even an omniscient being <i>could</i>
know. One astronomer traces the course of
the sun round the earth, another imagines that
of the earth round the sun. Some future improvements
in science may enable us to ascertain
which conjecture is the true one. We
shall then have ascertained a fact, which fact
may lead to the discovery of other facts, and
so on. Until this plain and simple view of the
nature of all science be generally received, all
the advances we may make in it are comparatively
as nothing. Until we occupy ourselves
in examining, observing, and ascertaining, and
not in <i>explaining</i>, we are idly and childishly
employed.—With every truth we may discover
we shall mix a thousand errors; and,
for one matter of fact, we shall charge our
brain with a thousand fancies. To this leading
misconception of the real, and only possible
object of philosophical enquiry, I incline to
attribute all the modes and forms of human
superstition. The vague idea that some mysterious
cause not merely <i>precedes</i> but <i>produces</i>
the effect we behold, occasions us to wander
from the real object in search of an imaginary
one. We see the sun rise in the east: Instead
of confining our curiosity to the discovery of
the time and manner of its rising, and of its
course in the heavens, we ask also—<i>why</i> does
<span class='pageno' id='Page_180'>180</span>it rise? What <i>makes</i> it move? The more
ignorant immediately conceive some Being
spurring it through the heavens, with fiery
steeds, and on wheels of gold, while the more
learned tell us of laws of motion, decreed by
an almighty fiat, and sustained by an almighty
will. Imagine the truth of both suppositions:
In the one case, we should see the application
of what we call physical power in the driver
and the steeds followed by the motion of the
sun, and in the other, an almighty volition followed
by the motion of the sun. But, in
either case, should we understand <i>why</i> the sun
moved?—<i>why</i> or <i>how</i> its motion followed
what we call the impulse of the propelling
power, or the propelling volition? All that
we could <i>then</i> know, more than we <i>now</i> know,
would be, that the occurrence of the motion of
the sun was preceded by another occurrence;
and if we afterwards frequently observed the
same sequence of occurrences, they would become
associated in our mind as necessary precedent
and consequent—as cause and effect:
and we might give to them the appellation of
law of nature, or any other appellation; but
they would still constitute merely a truth—that
is, <i>a fact</i>, and envelope no other mystery,
than that involved in every occurrence and
every existence.”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_181'>181</span>“But, according to this doctrine,” said
Theon, “there would be no less reason in attributing
the beautiful arrangement of the material
world to the motion of a horse, than to
the volition of an almighty mind.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“If I saw the motion of a horse followed by
the effect you speak of, I should believe in
some relation between them; and if I saw it
follow the volition of an almighty mind—the
same.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“But the cause would be inadequate to the
effect.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“It could not be so, if it were the cause.
For what constitutes the adequacy of which
you speak? Clearly only the contact, or immediate
proximity of the two occurrences. If
any sequence could in fact be more wonderful
than another, it should rather seem to be for
the consequent to impart grandeur to the precedent—the
effect to the cause,—than for the
cause to impart grandeur to the effect. But in
reality all sequences are equally wonderful.
That light should follow the appearance of the
sun, is just as wonderful, and no more so, as if
it were to follow the appearance of any other
body—and did light follow the appearance of
a black stone it would excite astonishment simply
because we never saw light follow such
an appearance before. Accustomed, as we
<span class='pageno' id='Page_182'>182</span>now are, to see light when the sun rises, our
wonder would be, if we did not see light when
he rose: but were light regularly to attend the
appearance of any other body, our wonder at
such a sequence would, after a time, cease;
and we should then say, as we now say, there
is light, <i>because</i> such a body has risen; and
imagine <i>then</i>, as we imagine <i>now</i>, that we understand
<i>why</i> light is.</p>

<p class='c009'>“In like manner all existences are equally
wonderful. An African lion is in himself
nothing more extraordinary than a Grecian
horse; although the whole people of Athens
will assemble to gaze on the lion, and exclaim,
how wonderful! while no man observes the
horse.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“True—but this is the wondering of ignorance.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I reply—true again, but so is all wondering.
If, indeed, we should consider it in this
and in all other cases as simply an emotion of
pleasurable surprise, acknowledging the presence
of a novel object, the feeling is perfectly
rational; but if it imagine any thing more intrinsically
marvellous in the novel existence
than in the familiar one, it is then clearly the
idle—that is, the unreasoned and unreflecting
marvelling of ignorance. There is but one
real wonder to the thinking mind: it is the existence
of all things; that is, the existence of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_183'>183</span>matter. And the only rational ground of this
one great wonder is, that the existence of matter
is the last link in the chain of cause and effect,
at which we can arrive. You imagine yet
another link—the existence of a power creating
that matter.—My only objections to this
additional link, or superadded cause, are, that
it is <i>imagined</i>, and that it leaves the wonder
as before; unless, indeed, we should say that
it has superadded other wonders, since it supposes
a power, or rather, an existence possessing
a power, of which we never saw an example.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“How so? Does not even man possess a
species of creating power? And do you not
suppose, in your inert matter, that very property
which others attribute, with more reason
it appears to me, to some superior and unknown
existence?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“By no means. No existence, that we know
of, possesses creating power, in the sense you
suppose. Neither the existence we call a man,
nor any of the existences, comprised under the
generic names of matter, physical world, nature,
&#38;c., possesses the power of calling into
being its own constituent elements, nor the
constituent elements of any other substance.
It can change one substance into another substance,
by altering the position of its particles,
or intermingling them with others: but it cannot
<span class='pageno' id='Page_184'>184</span>call into being, any more than it can annihilate,
those particles themselves. The hand
of man causes to approach particles of earth
and of water, and by their approximation, produces
clay; to which clay it gives a regular
form, and, by the application of fire, produces
the vessel we call a vase. You may say that
the hand of man creates the vase; but it does
not create the earth, or the water, or the fire;
neither has the admixture of these substances
added to, or subtracted from, the sum of their
elementary atoms. Observe, therefore, there is
no analogy between the power inherent in matter
of changing its appearance and qualities, by
a simple change in the position of its particles,
and that which you attribute to some unseen
existence, who, by a simple volition, should
have called into being matter itself, with all
its wonderful properties. An existence possessing
such a power I have never seen; and
though this says nothing against the possibility
of such an existence, it says every thing
against <i>my belief</i> in it. And farther, the power
which you attribute to this existence—that
of willing every thing out of nothing,—being,
not only what I have never seen, but that of
which I cannot with any distinctness conceive—it
must appear to me the greatest of
all improbabilities.”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_185'>185</span>“Our young friend,” observed Metrodorus,
“lately made use of an expression, the error
involved in which, seems to be at the root of
his difficulty. In speaking of matter,” he continued,
turning to Theon, “you employed the
epithet <i>inert</i>. What is your meaning? And
what matter do you here designate?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“All matter surely is, in itself, inert.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“All matter surely is, in itself, as it is,” said
Metrodorus with a smile; “and that, I should
say, is living and active. Again, what is matter?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“All that is evident to our senses,” replied
Theon, “and which stands opposed to mind.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“All matter then is inert which is devoid of
mind. What, then, do you understand by
mind?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I conceive some error in my definition,”
said Theon, smiling. “Should I say—<i>thought</i>—you
would ask if every existence
devoid of thought was inert, or if every existence,
possessing life, possessed thought?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I should so have asked. Mind or thought
I consider a quality of that matter constituting
the existence we call a man, which quality we
find in a varying degree in other existences;
many, perhaps all animals, possessing it. Life
is another quality, or combination of qualities,
of matter, inherent in—we know not how
<span class='pageno' id='Page_186'>186</span>many existences. We find it in vegetables;
we might perceive it even in stones, could we
watch their formation, growth, and decay.
We may call that active principle, pervading
the elements of all things, which approaches
and separates the component particles of the
ever changing, and yet ever during world—life.
Until you discover some substance, which undergoes
no change, you cannot speak of inert
matter: it can only be so, at least, relatively,—that
is, as compared with other substances.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“The classing of thought and life among
the qualities of matter is new to me.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“What is in a substance cannot be separate
from it. And is not all matter a compound of
qualities? Hardness, extension, form, color,
motion, rest—take away all these, and where
is matter? To conceive of mind independent
of matter, is as if we should conceive of color
independent of a substance colored: What is
form, if not a body of a particular shape?
What is thought, if not something which
thinks? Destroy the substance, and you destroy
its properties; and so equally—destroy
the properties, and you destroy the substance.
To suppose the possibility of retaining the one,
without the other, is an evident absurdity.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“The error of conceiving a quality in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_187'>187</span>abstract often offended me in the Lyceum,” returned
the youth, “but I never considered the
error as extending to mind and life, any more
than to vice and virtue.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“You stopped short with many others,” said
Leontium. “It is indeed surprising how many
acute minds will apply a logical train of reasoning
in one case, and invert the process in
another exactly similar.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“To return, and, if you will, to conclude
our discussion,” said Metrodorus, “I will observe
that no real advances can be made in
the philosophy of mind, without a deep scrutiny
into the operations of nature, or material
existences. Mind being only a quality of matter,
the study we call the philosophy of mind,
is necessarily only a branch of general physics,
or the study of a particular part of the philosophy
of matter.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I am indebted to your patience,” said the
youth, “and would fain intrude farther on it.
I will confine myself at present, however, to
one observation. The general view of things,
which you present to my mind, the simplicity
of which I will confess to be yet more fascinating
than its novelty, is evidently unfavorable
to religion,—and, if so, unfavorable to virtue.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“An opportunity will, to-day, be afforded
<span class='pageno' id='Page_188'>188</span>you,” said Leontium, “of examining this important
question in detail. At the request of
some of our youth, the Master will himself
give his views on the subject.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I am all curiosity,” said Theon. “Other
teachers have commanded my respect, inflamed
my imagination, and, I believe, often controlled
my reason. The son of Neocles inspires
me with love, and wins me to confidence
by encouraging me to exercise my own
judgment, in scanning his arguments, and examining
the groundwork of his own opinions.
With such a teacher, and in such a school, I
feel suspicion to be wholly misplaced; and I
shall now start in the road of enquiry, anxious
only to discover truth, and willing to part with
every erroneous opinion, the moment it shall
be proved to be erroneous.”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Note, by the Translator.</span> How beautifully have
the modern discoveries in chymistry and natural philosophy,
and the more accurate analysis of the human
mind—sciences unknown to the ancient world—substantiated
the leading principles of the Epicurean ethics
and physics—the only ancient school of either, really
deserving the name!</p>

<p class='c011'>To what have all our ingenious inventions and contrivances,
for the analysis of material substances, led us,
but to the atoms of Epicurus? To what, our accurate
observation of the decomposition of substances, and the
arresting and weighing of their most subtle and invisible
elements, but to the eternal and unchangeable nature of
those atoms? We have, in the course of our scrutiny,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_189'>189</span>superadded to the wonderful qualities of matter with
which he was acquainted, those which we call attraction,
repulsion, electricity, magnetism, &#38;c. How do
these discoveries multiply and magnify the living powers
inherent in the simple elements of all existences,
and point our admiration to the sagacity of that intellect
which, 2,000 years ago, started in the true road of enquiry;
while, at this day, thousands of teachers and
millions of scholars are stumbling in the paths of error!</p>

<p class='c011'>If we look to our mental philosophy, to what has
our scrutiny led, but to the leading principles of Epicurean
ethics? In the pleasure,—utility,—propriety of
human action—(whatever word we employ, the meaning
is the same)—in the consequences of human actions,
that is, in their tendency to promote our good or
our evil, we must ever find the only test of their intrinsic
merit or demerit.</p>

<p class='c011'>It might seem strange that, while the truth of the
leading principles of the Epicurean philosophy have
been long admitted by all sound reasoners, the abuse of
the school and of its founder is continued to this day:
this might and would seem strange and incomprehensible,
did we not, on every subject, find the same cowardly
fear of facing, openly and honestly, the prejudices
of men. Teachers, aware of the ignorance of those
they teach, develope their doctrines in language intelligible
only to the few; or, where they hazard a more
distinct exposition of truth, shelter themselves from obloquy,
by echoing the vulgar censure against those who
have taught the same truth, with more explicitness, before
them. The mass, even of what is called the educated
world, know nothing of the principles they decry,
or of the characters they abuse. It is easy, therefore,
by joining in the abuse against the one, to encourage a
belief that we cannot be advocating the other. This
desire of standing fair with the wise, without incurring
the enmity of the ignorant, may suit with the object of
those who acquire knowledge only for its display, or for
the gratification of mere curiosity. But they, whose nobler
aim, and higher gift it is, to advance the human
mind in the discovery of truth, must stand proof equally
<span class='pageno' id='Page_190'>190</span>to censure and to praise. That such lips and such pens
should employ equivocation, or other artifice, to turn
aside the wrath of ignorance, is degrading to themselves
and mortifying to their admirers. The late amiable and
enlightened teacher, Thomas Brown, of Edinburgh,
whose masterly exposition of old and new truths, and
exposure of modern as well as ancient errors, has so
advanced the science he professed, is yet chargeable
with this weakness. After inculcating the leading principles,
the whole of his beautiful system, he condescends
to soothe the prejudices which all his arguments
have tended to uproot, by passing a sweeping censure
on the school, whose doctrines he has borrowed and
taught. We might say—how unworthy of such a
mind! But we will rather say—how is it to be lamented
that such a mind bears not within itself the conviction,
that <i>all</i> truths are important to <i>all</i> men; and that to
employ deception with the ignorant, is to defeat our own
purpose; which is, surely, not to open the eyes of those
who already see, but to enlighten the blind!</p>

  <h2 class='c006'>CHAPTER XVI.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'>A more than usual crowd attended the instructions
of the Sage. The gay, and the curious,
the learned, and the idle, of all ages, and
of either sex, from the restless population of
the city; many citizens of note, collected from
various parts of Attica; and no inconsiderable
portion of strangers from foreign states and
countries.</p>

<p class='c009'>They were assembled on the lawn, surrounding
the temple already frequently mentioned.
The contracting waters of Ilyssus
flowed nearly in their accustomed bed; and
earth and air, refreshed by the storm of the
preceding night, resisted the rays of the uncurtained
sun, now climbing high in the heavens.
A crowd of recollections rushed on the
young mind of Theon, as he entered the beautiful
enclosure, and gazed on the stream which
formed one of its boundaries. His thoughts
again played truant to philosophy, and his
rapid glance sought another and a fairer form
than any it found there, when the approach of
Epicurus divided the throng, and hushed the
loud murmur of tongues into silence. The
<span class='pageno' id='Page_192'>192</span>Sage passed on, and it was not till he ascended
the marble steps, and turned to address the assembly,
that Theon perceived he had been followed
by the beautiful being who ruled his
fancy. The hues of Hebe now dyed her lips
and her cheeks; but the laughing smiles of the
preceding evening were changed for the composure
of respectful attention. Her eye caught
that of Theon. She gave a blush and a smile
of recognition. Then, seating herself at the
base of a column to the right of her father, her
face resumed its composure, and her full dark
eyes fastened on the countenance of the Sage,
in a gaze of mingled admiration and filial
love.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Fellow citizens, and fellow-men! We
purpose, this day, to examine a question of
vital importance to human kind: no less a one
than the relations we bear to all the existences
that surround us; the position we hold in
this beautiful material world; the origin,
the object, and the end of our being; the
source from which we proceed, and the goal
to which we tend.—This question embraces
many. It embraces all most interesting to our
curiosity, and influential over our happiness.
Its correct or incorrect solution must ever regulate,
as it now regulates, our rule of conduct,
our conceptions of right and wrong; must start
<span class='pageno' id='Page_193'>193</span>us in the road of true or false enquiry, and
either open our minds to such a knowledge of
the wonders working in and around us, as our
senses and faculties can attain, or close them
forever with the bands of superstition, leaving
us a prey to fear, the slaves of our ungoverned
imaginations, wondering and trembling at
every occurrence in nature, and making our
own existence and destiny sources of dread and
of mystery.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Ere we come to this important enquiry, it
behooves us to see that we come with willing
minds; that we say not, ‘so far will we go
and no farther; we will make one step, but
not two; we will examine, but only so long as
the result of our examination shall confirm our
preconceived opinions.’ In our search after
truth, we must equally discard presumption
and fear. We must come with our eyes and
our ears, our hearts and our understandings,
open; anxious, not to find <i>ourselves</i> right, but
to discover what is right; asserting nothing
which we cannot prove; believing nothing
which we have not examined; and examining
all things fearlessly, dispassionately, perseveringly.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“In our preceding discourses, and, for such
as have not attended these, in our writings, we
have endeavored to explain the real object of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_194'>194</span>philosophical enquiry; we have directed you
to the investigation of nature, to all that you
see of existences and occurrences around you;
and we have shown that, in these existences,
and occurrences, all that <i>can</i> be known, and
all that <i>there is</i> to be known, lies hid. We
have exhorted you to use your eyes, and your
judgments, never your imagination; to abstain
from theory, and rest with facts; and to understand
that in the accumulation of facts, as regards
the nature and properties of substances,
the order of occurrences, and the consequences
of actions, lies the whole science of philosophy,
physical and moral. We have seen, in
the course of our enquiry, that in matter itself,
exist all causes and effects; that the eternal
particles, composing all substances, from the
first and last links in the chain of occurrences,
or of cause and effect, at which we can arrive;
that the qualities, inherent in these particles,
produce, or are followed by certain effects; that
the changes, in position, of these particles, produce
or are followed by certain other qualities
and effects; that the sun appears, and that
light follows his appearance; that we throw a
pearl into vinegar, and that the pearl vanishes
from our eyes, to assume the form or forms of
more subtle, but not less real substances; that
the component particles of a human being fall
<span class='pageno' id='Page_195'>195</span>asunder, and that, instead of a man, we find a
variety of other substances or existences, presenting
new appearances, and new properties
or powers; that a burning coal touches our
hand, that the sensation of pain follows the
contact, that the desire to end this sensation is
the next effect in succession, and that the muscular
motion of withdrawing the hand, following
the desire, is another. That in all this
succession of existences and events, there is
nothing but what we see, or what we could
see, if we had better eyes; that there is no
mystery in nature, but that involved in the
very existence of all things; and that things
being as they are, is no more wonderful, than
it would be, if they were different. That an
analogous course of events, or chain of causes
and effects, takes place in morals as in physics:
that is to say, in examining those qualities,
of the matter composing our own bodies,
which we call mind, we can only trace a train
of occurrences, in like manner as we do in the
external world; that our sensations, thoughts,
and emotions, are simply effects following causes,
a series of consecutive phenomena, mutually
producing and produced.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“When we have taken this view of things,
observe how all abstruse questions disappear;
how all science is simplified; all knowledge
<span class='pageno' id='Page_196'>196</span>rendered easy and familiar to the mind! Once
started in this only true road of enquiry, every
step we make is one in advance. To whatever
science we apply, that is, to whatever
part of matter, or to whichever of its qualities,
we direct our attention, we shall, in all probability,
make important, because true, discoveries.
Is it the philosophy of nature in general,
or any one of those subdivisions of it, which
we call the philosophy of Mind, Ethics, Medicine,
Astronomy, Geometry, &#38;c., the moment
we occupy ourselves in observing and arranging
in order the facts, which are discovered in
the course of observation, we acquire positive
knowledge, and may safely undertake to develope
it to others.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“The ascertaining the nature of existences,
the order of occurrences, and the consequences
of human actions constituting, therefore, the
whole of knowledge, what is there to prevent
each and all of us from extending our discoveries
to the full limits prescribed by the nature
of our faculties and duration of our existence?
What noble employment can we invent? what
pleasure so pure, so little liable to disappointment?
What is there to hold us back?—What
is there not to spur us forward? Does
our ignorance start from the very simplicity of
knowledge? Do we fear to open our eyes lest
<span class='pageno' id='Page_197'>197</span>we should see the light? Does the very truth
we seek alarm us in its attainment?—How is
it that, placed in this world as on a theatre of
observation, surrounded by wonders and endowed
with faculties wherewith to scan these
wonders, we know so little of what is, and
imagine so much of what is not? Other animals,
to whom man accounts himself superior,
exercise the faculties they possess, trust their
testimony, follow the impulses of their nature,
and enjoy the happiness of which they are capable.
Man alone, the most gifted of all
known existences, doubts the evidence of his
superior senses, perverts the nature and uses of
his multiplied faculties, controls his most innocent,
as well as his noblest impulses, and turns
to poison all the sources of his happiness. To
what are we to trace this fatal error, this cruel
self-martyrdom, this perversion of things from
their natural bent? In the over-development
of one faculty and neglect of another, we must
seek the cause. In the imagination, that
source of our most beautiful pleasures, when
under the control of judgment, we find the
source of our worst afflictions.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“From an early age I have made the nature
and condition of man my study. I have found
him in many countries of the earth, under the
influence of all varieties of climate and circumstance;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_198'>198</span>I have found him the savage lord of
the forest, clothed in the rough skins of animals
less rude than himself, sheltered in the crevices
of the mountains and caves of the earth from
the blasts of winter and heats of the summer
sun; I have found him the slave of masters debased
as himself, crouching to the foot that
spurns him, and showing no signs of miscalled
civilization but its sloth and its sensualities; I
have found him the lord over millions, clothed
in purple and treading courts of marble; the
cruel destroyer of his species, marching
through blood and rapine, to thrones of extended
dominion; the iron-hearted tyrant,
feasting on the agonies of his victims, and
wringing his treasure from the hard earned
mite of industry; I have found him the harmless
but ignorant tiller of the soil, eating
the simple fruits of his labor, sinking to rest
only to rise again to toil, toiling to live and
living only to die; I have found him the polished
courtier, the accomplished scholar, the
gifted artist, the creating genius; the fool and
the knave; rich and a beggar; spurning and
spurned.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Under all these forms and varieties of the
external and internal man, still, with hardly
an exception, I have found him unhappy.
With more capacity for enjoyment than any
<span class='pageno' id='Page_199'>199</span>other creature, I have seen him surpassing the
rest of existences only in suffering and crime.
Why is this and from whence? What master
error, for some there must be, leads to results
so fatal—so opposed to the apparent nature
and promise of things? Long have I sought
this error—this main-spring of human folly
and human crime. I have traced, through all
their lengthened train of consequents and causes,
human practice and human theory; I
have threaded the labyrinth to its dark beginning;
I have found the first link in the chain of
evil; I have found it—in all countries—among
all tribes and tongues and nations; I
have found it,—Fellow-men, I have found it
in—<span class='sc'>Religion</span>!”</p>

<p class='c009'>A low murmur here rose from one part of
the assembly. A deep and breathless silence
succeeded. The Sage turned his gaze slowly
around, and with a countenance, pure and
serene as the skies which shone above him,
proceeded:—</p>

<p class='c009'>“We have named the leading error of the
human mind,—the bane of human happiness—the
perverter of human virtue! It is
Religion—that dark coinage of trembling ignorance!
It is Religion—that poisoner of
human felicity! It is Religion—that blind
guide of human reason! It is Religion—that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_200'>200</span>dethroner of human virtue! which lies at the
root of all the evil and all the misery that pervade
the world!</p>

<p class='c009'>“Not hastily formed, still less hastily expressed,
has been the opinion you hear this
day. A long train of reflection led to the discarding
of religion as an error, a life of observation
to the denouncing it as an evil. In
considering it as devoid of truth, I am but one
of many. Few have looked deeply and steadily
into the nature of things, and not called in
question belief in existences unseen and causes
unknown. But while smiling at the credulity
of their fellow-beings, philosophers have
thought reason good only for themselves.
They have argued that religion, however
childish a chimera in itself, was useful in its
tendencies: that, if it rested upon nothing, it
supported all things; that it was the stay of
virtue, and the source of happiness. However
opposed to every rule in philosophy, physical
and moral; however apparently in contradiction
to reason and common sense, that a thing
untrue could be useful; that a belief in facts
disproved or unproved could afford a sustaining
prop to a just rule of practice; the assertion
came supported by so universal a testimony
of mankind, and by individual names
of such authority in practical wisdom and virtue,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_201'>201</span>that I hesitated to call it mistaken. And
as human happiness appeared to me the great
desideratum, and its promotion the only object
consistent with the views of a teacher of men,
I forbore from all expression of opinion, until I
had fully substantiated, to my own conviction,
both its truth and its tendency. The <i>truth</i> of
my opinion is substantiated, as we have seen,
by an examination into the nature of things;
that is, into the properties of matter, which
are alone sufficient to produce all the chances
and changes that we behold. Its <i>tendency</i> is
discovered by an examination into the moral
condition of man.</p>

<p class='c009'>“The belief in supernatural existences, and
expectation of a future life, are said to be
sources of happiness, and stimuli to virtue.
How, and in what way? Is it proved by experience?
Look abroad over the earth: every
where the song of praise, the prayer of supplication,
the smoke of incense, the blow of sacrifice,
arise from forest, and lawn, from cottage,
palace, and temple, to the gods of human
idolatry. Religion is spread over the earth.
If she be the parent of virtue and happiness,
they too should cover the earth. Do they so?
Read the annals of human tradition! Go
forth and observe the actions of men! Who
shall speak of virtue—who of happiness, that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_202'>202</span>hath eyes to see and ears to hear and hearts to
feel? No! experience is against the assertion.
The world is full of religion, and full of misery
and crime.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Can the assertion be sustained by argument,
by any train of reasoning whatsoever?
Imagine a Deity under any fashion of existence;
how are our dreams concerning him in
an imaginary heaven to affect our happiness or
our conduct on a tangible earth? Affect it indeed
they may for evil, but how for good?
The idea of an unseen Being, ever at work
around and about us, may afflict the human
intellect with idle terrors, but can never guide
the human practice to what is rational and
consistent with our nature. Grant that, by
any possibility, we could ascertain the existence
of one god, or of a million of gods: we
see them not, we hear them not, we feel them
not. Unless they were submitted to our observation,
were fashioned like unto us, had similar
desires, similar faculties, a similar organization,
how could their mode of existence
afford a guide for ours? As well should the
butterfly take pattern from the lion, or the lion
from the eagle, as man from a god. To say
nothing of the inconsistency of the attributes,
with which all gods are decked, it is enough
that none of them are ours. We are men;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_203'>203</span>they are gods. They inhabit other worlds;
we inhabit the earth. Let them enjoy their
felicity; and let us, my friends, seek ours.</p>

<p class='c009'>“But it is not that religion is merely useless,
it is mischievous. It is mischievous by its idle
terrors; it is mischievous by its false morality;
it is mischievous by its hypocrisy; by its fanaticism;
by its dogmatism; by its threats;
by its hopes; by its promises. Consider it
under its mildest and most amiable form, it is
still mischievous as inspiring false motives of
action, as holding the human mind in bondage,
and diverting the attention from things
useful, to things useless. The essence of religion
is fear, as its source is ignorance. In a
certain stage of human knowledge, the human
mind must of necessity, in its ignorance of the
properties of matter, and its dark insight into
the chain of phenomena arising out of those
properties—must of necessity reason falsely
on every occurrence and existence in nature;
it must of necessity, in the absence of fact,
give the rein to fancy, see a miracle in every
uncommon event, and imagine unseen agents
as producing all that it beholds. In proportion
as the range of our observation is enlarged,
and as we learn to connect and arrange
the phenomena of nature, we curtail our list of
miracles, the number of our supernatural
<span class='pageno' id='Page_204'>204</span>agents. An eclipse is alarming to the vulgar,
as denoting the wrath of offended deities; to
the man of science it is a simple occurrence, as
easily traced to its cause, as any the most familiar
to our observation. The knowledge of
one generation is the ignorance of the next.
Our superstitions decrease as our attainments
multiply; and the fervor of our religion declines
as we draw nearer to the conclusion
which destroys it entirely. The conclusion,
based upon accumulated facts, as we have
seen, that matter alone is at once the thing
acting, and the thing acted upon,—eternal in
duration, infinitely various and varying in appearance;
never diminishing in quantity, and
always changing in form. Without some
knowledge of what is styled natural philosophy,
or physics, no individual can attain this
conclusion. And in a <i>certain</i> stage of that
knowledge, more or less advanced according to
the acuteness of the intellect, it will be impossible
for any individual, not mentally obtuse,
to shun that conclusion. This truth is one of
infinite importance. The moment we consider
the hostility directed against what is called
Atheism, as the natural result of deficient information,
the mind must be diseased which
could resent that hostility. And perhaps a
simple statement of the truth would best lead
<span class='pageno' id='Page_205'>205</span>to examination of the subject, and to the conversion
of mankind.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Imagine this conversion, my friends! Imagine
the creature man in the full exercise of
all his faculties; not shrinking from knowledge,
but eager in its pursuit; not bending the
knee of adulation to visionary beings armed
by fear for his destruction, but standing erect
in calm contemplation of the beautiful face of
nature; discarding prejudice, and admitting
truth without fear of consequences; acknowledging
no judge but reason, no censor but that
in his own breast! Thus considered, he is
transformed into the god of his present idolatry,
or rather into a far nobler being, possessing
all the attributes consistent with virtue and
reason, and none opposed to either. How
great a contrast with his actual state! His
best faculties dormant; his judgment unawakened
within him; his very senses misemployed;
all his energies misdirected; trembling
before the coinage of his own idle fancy;
seeing over all creation a hand of tyranny extended;
and instead of following virtue, worshipping
power! Monstrous creation of ignorance!
monstrous degradation of the noblest of
known existences! Man, boasting of superior
reason, of moral discrimination, imagines a
being at once unjust, cruel, and inconsistent;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_206'>206</span>then kissing the dust, calls himself its slave!
‘This world <i>is</i>,’ says the Theist, ‘therefore it
was made’—By whom?—‘By a being more
powerful than I.’ Grant this infantine reasoning,
what follows as the conclusion? ‘That
we must fear him,’ says the Theist.—And
why? Is his power directed against our happiness?
Does your god amuse himself by
awakening the terrors of more helpless beings?
Fear him then indeed we may; and, let our
conduct be what it will, fear him we <i>must</i>.
‘He is good as well as powerful,’ says the
Theist; ‘therefore the object of love.’—How
do we ascertain his goodness? I see indeed a
beautiful and curious world; but I see it full
of moral evils, and presenting many physical
imperfections. Is he all-powerful? perfect
good or perfect evil might exist. Is he all-powerful
<i>and</i> all-good? perfect good <i>must</i>
exist. Of the sentient beings comprised in the
infinity of matter I know but those which I
behold. I set no limits to the number of those
which I behold not; no bounds to their power.
One or many, may have given directions to
the elementary atoms, and may have fashioned
this earth as the potter fashions its clay.
Beings possessing such power may exist, and
may have exercised it. <i>All</i>-powerful still they
are not, or being so, they are wicked: <i>evil exists</i>.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_207'>207</span>I know not what <i>may</i> be—but this my
moral sense tells me <span class='fss'>CANNOT</span> be—a fashioner
of the world I inhabit, in his nature all-good
and all-powerful. I see yet another impossibility;
a fashioner of this world in his nature
all-good and <i>fore-knowing</i>. Granting the
possibility of the attributes, their united existence
were an impossible supposition in the
architect of our earth.</p>

<p class='c009'>‘Let us accord his goodness, the most pleasing
and valuable attribute. Your god is then
the object of our love, and of our pity. Of
our love, because being benevolent in his own
nature, he must have intended to produce happiness
in forming ours; of our pity, because
we see that he has failed in his intention. I
cannot conceive a condition more unfortunate
than that of a deity contemplating this world
of his creation. Is he the author of some—say,
of much happiness? of what untold misery
is he equally the author? I cannot conceive
a being more desperately—more hopelessly
wretched than that we have now pictured.
The worst of human miseries shrink into
comparative insignificancy before those of their
author. How must every sigh drawn from the
bosom of man rend the heart of his god!
How must every violence committed on earth
convulse the peace of heaven! unable to alter
<span class='pageno' id='Page_208'>208</span>what he had fashioned, how must he equally
curse his power and his impotence! And, in
bewailing our existence, how must he burn to
annihilate his own!</p>

<p class='c009'>“We will now suppose his power without
limit; and his knowledge extending to the future,
as to the past. How monstrous the conception!
What demon drawn from the fevered
brain of insanity, ever surpassed this
deity in malignity! Able to make perfection,
he hath sown through all nature the seed of
evil. The lion pursues the lamb; the vulture,
in his rage, tears the dove from her nest.
Man, the universal enemy, triumphs even in
the sufferings of his fellow-beings; in their
pain finds his own joy; in their loss, his gain;
in the frenzy of his violence, working out his
own destruction; in the folly of his ignorance
cursing his own race, and blessing its cruel
author! Your deity is the author of evil, and
you call him good; the inventor of misery,
and you call him happy! What virtuous
mind shall yield homage to such a Being?
Who shall say, that homage, if rendered, degrades
not the worshipper? Or, who shall say,
that homage, when rendered, shall pacify the
idol? Will abjectness in the slave ensure
mercy in the tyrant? Or, if it should, my
friends, which of us would be the abject? Are
<span class='pageno' id='Page_209'>209</span>men found bold to resist earthly oppression,
and shall they bow before injustice, because
she speak from Heaven? Does the name of
Harmodius inspire our songs? Do crowns of
laurel bind the temples of Aristogition? Let
our courage rise higher than theirs, my friends;
and, if worthy of ambition, our fame! Dethrone,
not the tyrant of Athens, but the tyrant
of the earth!—not the oppressor of Athenians,
but the oppressor of mankind! Stand forth!
Stand erect! Say to this god, ‘if you made
us in malice, we will not worship you in fear.
We will judge of you by your works: and
judge your works with our reason. If evil
pervade them, you are chargeable with it, as
their author. We care not to conciliate your
injustice, any more than to strive with your
power. We judge of the future from the past.
And as you have disposed of us in this world,
so, if it please you to continue our being, must
you dispose of us in another. It would be
idle to strive with Omnipotence, or to provide
against the decrees of Omniscience. We will
not torment ourselves by imagining your intentions;
nor debase ourselves by expostulations.
Should you punish, in us, the evil you have
made, you will punish it as unjustly as you
made it maliciously. Should you reward in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_210'>210</span>us the good, you will reward it absurdly, as it
was equally your work, and not ours.’</p>

<p class='c009'>“Let us now concede in argument the union
of all the enumerated attributes. Let us accord
the existence of a being perfect in goodness,
wisdom, and power, who shall have
made all things by his volition, and decreed all
occurrences in his wisdom. Such a being
must command our admiration and approval:
he can command no more. As he is good and
wise, he is superior to all praise; as he is great
and happy, he is independent of all praise.
As he is the author of our happiness, he has
ensured our love; but as he is our creator, he
may command from us no duties. Supposing
a god, all duties rest with him. If he has
made us, he is bound to make us happy; and
failing in the duty, he must be an object of
just abhorrence to all his sentient creation.
Kindness received must necessarily inspire
affection. This kindness, in a divine creator,
as in an earthly parent, is a solemn duty,—a
sacred obligation,—the non-performance of
which were the most atrocious of crimes.
When performed, love from the creature, as
from the child, is a necessary consequence, and
an all-sufficient reward.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Allowing then to the Theist his god, we
stand to him in no relation that can inspire
<span class='pageno' id='Page_211'>211</span>fear, or involve duty. He can give us no happiness
that he was not bound to bestow: he
can cherish us with no tenderness, that he was
not bound to yield. It is for him to gratify all
our desires,—or, if they be erroneous, to correct
them. It is for us to demand every good
in his power to grant, or in ours to enjoy. Let
then, the theologist banish fear and duty from
his creed. It is love—love alone that can be
claimed by gods or yielded by men.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Have we said enough! Surely the absurdity
of all the doctrines of religion, and the
iniquity of many, are sufficiently evident. To
fear a being on account of his power, is degrading;
to fear him if he be good, ridiculous.
Prove to us his existence; and prove to us his
perfections; prove to us his parental care;
love springs up in our bosoms, and repays his
bounty. If he care not to show us his existence,
he desires not the payment of our love,
and finds in the contemplation of his own
works, their reward.</p>

<p class='c009'>“But, says the Theist, his existence is evident—and,
not to acknowledge it, a crime.
It is not so to me, my friends. I see no sufficient
evidence of his existence; and to reason
of its possibility, I hold to be an idle speculation.
To doubt that which is evident is not in
our power. To believe that which is not evident,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_212'>212</span>is equally impossible to us. Theist!
thou makest of thy god a being more weak,
more silly than thyself. He punisheth as a
crime the doubt of his existence! Why, then,
let him declare his existence, and we doubt no
more. Should the wandering tribes of Scythia
doubt the existence of Epicurus, should Epicurus
be angry? What vanity—what absurdity—what
silliness, oh! Theist! do ye not
suppose in your god! Let him exist, this god,
in all the perfection of a poet’s imagery; I lift
to him a forehead assured and serene. ‘I see
thee, oh! God! in thy power, and admire
thee: I see thee in thy goodness, and approve
thee. Such homage only is worthy of thee to
receive, and of me to render.’ And what does
he reply? ‘Thou art right, creature of my
fashioning! Thou canst not add nor take
away from the sum of my felicity. I made
thee to enjoy thy own, not to wonder at mine.
I have placed thee amid objects of desire, I
have given thee means of enjoyment. Enjoy,
then! Be happy! It was for that I made
thee.’</p>

<p class='c009'>“Harken, then, my children! hearken to
your teacher! Let it be a god or a philosopher
who speaks, the injunction is the same: <i>Enjoy,
and be happy!</i> Is life short? It is an
evil: But render life happy, its shortness is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_213'>213</span>the <i>only</i> evil. I call to you, as, if he exist,
God must call to you from heaven: <i>Enjoy,
and be happy!</i> Do you doubt the way? Let
Epicurus be your guide. The source of every
enjoyment is within yourselves. Good and
evil lie before you. The good is—all which
can yield you pleasure: the evil—what must
bring you pain. Here is no paradox, no dark
saying, no moral hid in fables.</p>

<p class='c009'>“We have considered the unsound fabric of
religion. It remains to consider that, equally
unsound, of morals. The virtue of man is
false as his faith. What folly invented,
knavery supports. Let us arise in our
strength, examine, judge, and be free!”</p>

<p class='c009'>The teacher here paused. The crowd stood,
as if yet listening. “At a convenient season,
my children, we will examine farther into the
nature of man and the science of life.”</p>

1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be

agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the

of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
